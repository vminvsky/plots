"When someone decides they shouldn't be a parent we should trust them. They know better than we do.

You'd rather force someone to give birth against their will, mandating a sentient human to be created to experience suffering. An unwanted child likely to be resented, damning they, their parent, and the society they inhabit to [a worse outcome of poverty and crime.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalized_abortion_and_crime_effect) For what?

"I also want to comment again and say that I feel those that say we will regret it are probably the same ones who say women regret having abortions. I know about 17 people, including myself, who have had an abortion and not a single that I know regrets it.  They make it sound like every woman is crying herself to sleep at night and will regret it also but where the hell are all these regretful people??     
I mean there may be one or two here and there. One person I know says she sometimes wonders what that kid would be like but she didn’t say she regretted it. It was not a good time at that moment. She has kids herself and had them later when she was married. Heck, I sometimes let my mind wander and imagine different scenarios in regards to my life. Every once in a while when I’m reflecting on how glad I was to never have kids (46f) I sometimes try an imagine how different my life would be if I had decided to have that baby. I can’t say I dwell much on whether it would be a boy or girl or what it would even look like. It’s more a hypothetical thought and how it would affect my life. I think about how I would have juggled a job etc. But I’m not sad about it at all. In fact I’m so thankful that option was available to me and that it was done legally and safely. I think it’s normal just to once in a while wonder how your life would have turned out had you chosen another path. So glad I didn’t!",2021-11-08 01:58:10,hjr4wvy,14.0,ksarahsarah27,childfree

"I would appreciate your respect in the debate, as that is a rule on this sub.

\&gt;You're moving the goalposts right now. You didn't introduce the rapist's actions as ""morally problematic"", you introduced them as ""problematic"", and that's the language I adopted in subsequent responses. Not only are you refusing to read what I write, it seems you're not even reading what you write.

You yourself introduced the concept of morality into this debate, right here

\&gt;The only way you would think it's not analogous is if you think the point is to equivocate between the moral guilt of the rapist and the moral guilt of the fetus, but it's not. As it pertains to abortion, the fetus is not morally blameworthy at all, and is not akin to to rapist in this way. 

Also, I now see what you were trying to do, but it is not realistic. You are trying to say that when you compare pregnancy to rape that you are comparing PLs to the rapists. Which is nonsensical. No wonder I missed it. The obvious conclusion is someone must be physically violating in a rape analogy. The PL is doing no such thing. 

\&gt;Again, we're not deciding how to ""view"" anyone. Get it through your skull.

This strikes me as dishonest. You said that the PL is as morally blameworthy as a rapist. You want to claim that is not a ""view""? Please. 

\&gt;Yes you did. If a pregnancy can be deliberately stopped, its procedure is not beyond anyone's control. End of story.

This is invalid logically. Go is not stop and stop is not go. Proceed is not end. Stopping pregnancy is not continuing pregnancy. You have made a mistake saying being able to stop something is the same as making something go. That is false. Admit it or try something else. 

\&gt;Funny that literally none of you people can do it then. Even here all you do is flaccidly appeal to what some imagined authority has said. If you want to tag out, go ahead. I'll grind their arguments down too.

"You're *still* missing the point. 

Whether you think abortion is either the best thing ever and should be completely legal until 30 seconds before the mom goes into labor, literal fucking baby murder or something in between that? 

That has no bearing on how open you are to some socialist alleged utopia. You're doing the exact same behavior OP described originally.

&gt;but it's a damn shame so not be able to get an abortion to stop it or get financial aid to swing it.

""hey if I end up pregnant, I should either be able to kill the kid or receive endless government money if having said kid will even slightly inconvenience me""

"I put my hand to my forehead as I read the chart again. I couldn't believe it. It was just too ironic, too unreal. It was after five and most everyone had gone home; that was the only way I got my hands on her file in the first place. Linda and I were the only ones left in the office, and she was too ensconced in paperwork to even notice me. The janitor was probably around here somewhere too, but if he saw me snooping around, he would just assume I was doing my job.

I sat down at the receptionist's desk and hesitantly pulled up her file on the computer, glancing back at Linda nervously as I did. She didn't even look up. ""Brown, Catherine."" I sifted through the minutia, looking for her next appointment time. She'd have to have made one. I can't imagine she'd be willing to tell her parents about this. She certainly wouldn't be going to the family pediatrician. Even though that doctor would actually be the most appropriate. It was a child having a child, after all.

I stared in shock when I found what I was looking for. She had made another appointment, but it wasn't for a check-up or an ultrasound or to get her pre-natal vitamins. It was for an abortion. I drifted into a sort of dream-like state as I pondered the implications of this. I couldn't blame her, of course. I'd been in the exact same position and made the exact same appointment at one time in my life. But she didn't know - she couldn't know - what she was getting into. She couldn't know how hard it was going to be. Not physically, but mentally. And what if one of those protest groups happens to be here the day she comes in? What if they call her a murderer on her way out? What if they make her question herself to the point of her being paralyzed, unable to go through with it, but at the same time, unable to not go through with it?

I wanted so badly to be there for her. But she had no idea who I was. And I wasn't even supposed to know her name. She needed me, though, and I was the only one who could really help her through this. I was the only one who truly understood the choice she was facing and the only one who would sympathize with her no matter what decision she ended up making. I felt a tear sliding down my cheek as I continued to stare blankly at the computer screen, wondering what I could do, trying to figure out a way around the formalities that kept me from talking to her. I wanted to tell her so many things, things that would seem so insignificant coming from  some random office administrator, but that would be life-changing coming from...

""Who's...Catherine Brown?"" Linda asked as she leaned over my left shoulder, squinting at the computer screen. I jumped, not even realizing she'd gotten up from the desk in the corner. Linda was a stickler for the rules and wouldn't hesitate to bitch me out for looking at any patient's file, much less this one, one I shouldn't be allowed anywhere near.

But I didn't care anymore. All I could think was that I had so much to say to this girl, and yet I couldn't even talk to her.

I felt the tears welling up again as I tried to maintain my composure long enough to give Linda an answer. To tell Linda the secret I'd been holding in for sixteen years. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. And then I spoke.

"Just gonna go ahead and copy a reply I made about this before you start getting the expected questions:


I’m happy to explain a little more of what she’s done if it will help, and I personally don’t believe she fully hates trans people, she’s just transphobic and doesn’t think of trans people as their gender.
Two of the tweets she favorited referred to trans women as “men in dresses” and explicitly stated “I’m saying transwomen are men”. These are both not merely accidental missteps out of ignorance like Julian Castro saying abortion must be protected as a health right for trans women (which to be clear I thought was super sweet and honestly validating), they are active transphobic attacks targeting trans women.


Another tweet was a link to a transphobic piece by Harvey Jeni who is so disruptively and radically hateful of trans people she was banned from Radical Bookfair.


Another was by Janice Turner who is perhaps best known for calling for her supporters to suspend direct debit donations to the UKs National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children because they had enlisted a transgender model named Munroe Bergdorf.


Rowling also wrote a book called The Silkworm under the pen name Robert Galbraith that includes a scene where a trans woman tries to stab the protagonist. The scene is full of stereotypes and everyone feels pity for the “unstable and aggressive” trans woman (another set of stereotypes), but not before our protagonist threatens her with “If you go for that door one more time I’m calling the police and I’ll testify and be glad to watch you go down for attempted murder. And it won’t be fun for you, Pippa,...Not pre-op.”


And finally the recent hubbub is because she started following Magdalen Berns on Twitter. J.K.Rowling, who has well over 14 million followers, only followed 663 accounts at the time, and now one of those is a self-professed transphobe who dedicates her account solely to directing misinformation and hate at trans women.


The other important thing to know about the people she’s liking and following is that they have hunting parties they organize on Twitter where they pick a trans person (almost always trans women because they don’t even think of trans men or non-binary people as existing) and mass harass them, then pick one of their tweets and mass-report it leading to twitter over and over and over suspending trans accounts for existing. In the words of Shon Faye, a trans woman who went through that delightful experience, “Trans culture is seeing the beloved author of your generation like a transphobic tweet from a troll account which has repeatedly called you a man.”


In short Rowling hasn’t said “I hate trans people and they’re delusional”, but she has favorited and followed things saying both of those repeatedly and her only written trans character is the sentence personified. I hope this has helped, but as a trans woman myself I gotta say I regret doing this research. It’s hard being reminded that the two biggest opinions of me outside of trans circles are “You’re a monsterous pervert” and “I mean whatever, let the dude say he’s a woman if he wants.”",2019-09-12 17:49:15,f0155ud,3.0,1987Ellen,UpliftingNews

If females can have abortion for free, you would be surprised to see how many people do not want to have children.  Some of those unwanted children might not end up being abused or neglected.

Sure in the rare case where you're doing everything right and a baby  happens ANYWAY I can understand being frustrated, children are expensive and take a lot of love and growing up( on your end) to take care of.

Sure, the system sucks dick and we're all getting fucked by it in one way or another...

Don't child support payments go down significantly if you're actually hanging out with and taking care of the kid too? From my understanding, the courts look at child support payments from the perspective of the child. An entity who had no say in whether or not in their birth. So its not like they're exactly doing the woman this HUGEEE favor just to stick it to the stinky men.

But I get it, you don't want the kid and you're having to pay for it whatever. But why do they act like the system in place is only out to get MEN? Excuse me?

Well actually I think we largely agree. And you're definition of life is roughly equivalent to mine. A reasonable non-arbitrary line to what we ought to consider the beginning of a human life to be ""does this human have the organ function necessary to continue to live outside of the womb"".

But I will disagree with you that pro-choice legislation tends to respect that distinction. Indeed. I don't believe I've seen any pro-choice legislation in the Anglosphere at least that treats fetuses as living at all, though I'd be happy to be proven wrong.

I am pro-choice. Functionally. But I often find myself arguing from a pro-life perspective against people who believe abortion should be totally unrestricted and completely free from moral gravity.

Just because I believe a woman has the right to control her body and who occupies it, even her unborn child, does not mean that I think an unborn fetus is unliving until it is born. Yet frequently, indeed here presently I'm arguing with people who make that exact statement. That a fetus does not matter until it has exited the womb.

"I've read some David Friedman and found him agreeable so it doesn't surprise me.  
  
Children are exactly the reason abortion is a no-contest - a needed gray area of allowance. If you can't take care of a fetus, remove it, unless it's actually a child now. A very young child has *somewhat* of a mind, and this rapidly grows into an actual mind, and gains complexity until 25, then keeps doing so, but more slowly, with periods of normal and rapid growth thrown in between 0 and 25. So, if someone can't take care of a formed child, capable of decisions (babies are minimally capable, but still human, unlike a 1-3 month fetus, which is more of a mushy phlegm blob with a better chance of becoming a human than a disunited sperm or ovum.  
  
On the case of children, there may or may not be adoptive parents available, or other means of surrogate parenting. The burden of fixing a broken home cannot lie on the economy or society, however, as no society in history has ever produced an ideal home life for everyone, or even most people. Shitty parents won't stop being shitty because you philosophize to them or about them, they still will exist - forever, probably. Personally, even if it were a great burden, I'd try as best I could to raise a child that it was too late to abort. Someone else, who knows, I certainly don't. There is no solution here, but I daresay there is no solution currently, either. I've known people who have seen horrible things in the foster care system, and even normal sources of information cite deep problems with adoption - children stolen or bought from other countries, children raped repeatedly because they slipped through the cracks, children who become sociopaths incapable of fitting into any family and are thrown from house to house until landing in prison at 18 for killing way to many family pets, or worse. The system is broken already, and wide-scale broken personal morality is not fixable by the death penalty, government, economy, or anything save a moral revolution - a new religion, so to speak, not necessarily literal, but something to inspire, instead of coerce, people to believe certain things are bad on a larger scale. Essentially, personal morality is unfixable except by the acceptance, personally, of a new morality.  
  
Because the mistreatment of children is wrong, but no solution exists in ANY system, the question merely centers on the individual's choices. Children cannot be expected to defend themselves in any society, and that includes going to the proper authorities over mistreatment, no matter what those authorities are. I can't see a solution, and the idea of children is entirely separate from the idea of pre-children. ",2018-10-09 07:58:20,e7fvkfe,-1.0,CodeReaper,Anarcho_Capitalism

"To save you from that abortion of a site:

&gt; Edge recounted a story of working with Luther in a street fight early on in his career.

&gt; “One lesson I learned so early on was with a guy, Dr. Luther, he’s now in AEW, and he was like the first experienced guy that I’d worked [with]. He’s been to Japan, he’d been in FMW and all these places. We were working, and it was probably like my fiftieth match or something and we’re having a Street Fight. So he calls the spot and I immediately want to do it. He went, ‘whoa, hold on. Pump the breaks. You got it?’ I was like, ‘Oh, I don’t have to go right away. I can actually stop and and and register what he said instead of just instantly go.’ I’ve never forgotten that lesson. He doesn’t even know it was a lesson for me, I’m sure. But that really, really — you know, the light bulb went off. There [were] a lot more light bulbs that needed to go off, but that was the first one that I distinctly remember going, ‘oh my God, he just cracked open my brain.’ This is different than I thought.”

"I can understand why you're upset. Teen pregnancy is a shocker, but being pregnant yourself is a double whammy. It's okay to feel those feelings, but you and your husband need to work through them and work with your daughter to find the best solution for her. 

Although, I really think you need to work through your perception about considering your daughter to be ""a sex addict"" while you were celibate for 7 years in a long-term committed relationship. Teenagers are horny even girls. It seems like you have a different relationship with sex, but holding this amount of judgment toward her is just not healthy for either of you. 

With statements like,""My husband and I do everything for her."" ""...since we finally gave her some freedom.."" it seems like y'all had her on a tight leash and when she was given some leeway she ran with it. She didn't trust you to talk with you about things. 

From here, you talk with her about her options while showing her respect. If you need to go to a therapy session to work through some of this, you could likely go with EAP to get therapy.  Ultimately, it is her body and her choice. 

You can explain the statistics of teen pregnancy and some of the negative long-term consequences and go through the options of talking about:

* abortion
* adoption
* keeping the baby

If she chooses to keep the baby, you need to be clear about if she's able to continue to live in your house, what her financial responsibilities are, what your household expectations are, what childcare responsibilities she would have, etc. DO NOT over-parent for her. This will make her lose confidence in her parenting skills and drive a wedge between you, her, the baby, etc. I'd honestly suggest some family therapy ASAP.

If she can't live with you and have the baby, there are emergency maternity homes. You can look for what is in your area. 

After the pregnancy, GET HER ON BIRTH CONTROL. As mentioned by another user, she's likely scared too. That time of life has a lot of transitions and showing love and support is really crucial with whatever choice she chooses to make.",2022-04-21 19:41:26,i5nojtq,157.0,pennybrowneyes,Mommit

"Awesome question. The classic answer can be found in Richard Hofstadter's 1963 book, *Anti-Intellectualism in American Life*. Hofstadter, who went on to win the 1964 Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction for the book, wrote:

&gt;""Anti-intellectualism . . . is founded in the democratic institutions and the egalitarian sentiments of this country.""

For Hofstadter, who traces anti-intellectualism to broadsheets levied against some of the first American presidential candidates, the roots go to the classic American debate between who governs best. Is it the mob, the vast majority of Americans who have little interest or knowledge in a topic, or is it a smaller and traditionally less representative group of people who have more experience and education on a topic?

As Woodrow Wilson said in 1912: ""What I fear is a government of experts. God forbid that in a democratic country we should resign the task and give the government over to experts. What are we for if we are to be scientifically taken care of by a small number of gentlemen who are the only men who understand the job?""

Hofstadter is still quoted frequently on this topic, but there are a lot of things he missed discussing, as Nicholas Lemann points out [in a wonderful 50th anniversary retrospective review](http://www.cjr.org/second_read/richard_hofstadter_tea_party.php).

Hofstadter (and plenty of people today) think of anti-intellectualism as solely the domain of the political right. But Hofstadter missed people like Donald Kagan, Robert Bork, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Allan Bloom, who wrote *The Closing of the American Mind.*

He also tended to describe business as anti-intellectual, when we know that today, business is one of the most intellectual-friendly branches of American society. America today hosts designers and inventors, innovators and trend-makers, rather than industrialists and manufacturers as it did in 1963, when Hofstadter was writing.

He also missed the rise of the Civil Rights movement for women and minorities in the United States.

That's getting a little off track, however. The bottom line is that there is (and has been) a constant push-pull between appeals to the ""mob"" and the ""elite"" in American society.

In *Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic,* Gordon Wood contends that the first 30 years of the United States resulted in a switch from the desires of the nation's founders ─ who were the elite of the nation ─ to the will of the middling people, those involved in commerce and enterprise.

The founders of the United States had envisioned a Congress and President who were already wealthy and thus immune from corruption. The thought went that they would be self-sacrificing and put aside their businesses to serve the national good for a period, then return to their own interests afterward. 

Joyce Appleby and Wood contend that the middle classes, who enriched themselves through industry and enterprise, developed a belief that the self-made man was the ideal politician, not someone who had been born wealthy, was educated, and thus theoretically could be trusted to make a decision without being swayed by public opinion.

And so we have a push and pull, dating back to the roots of the United States.

Hofstadter also makes the case that evangelical Protestantism in the United States, particularly in the South, strongly contributed to anti-intellectualism in the latter half of the 19th century and the 20th century. Mark Noll's *The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind* is a more in-depth analysis of this aspect.

Noll has done some excellent work on American religious history (I highly recommend his *The Civil War as a Theological Crisis*) and he explains that a lot of the American evangelical anti-intellectualism can be traced back to the development of a ""literalist"" interpretation of the Bible as a response to the anti-slavery movement of the 19th century. Before the 19th century, and particularly before the French Revolution, churches and religious organizations tended to be pro-science if they were anything. 

In the United States, this began to change as the arguments about slavery intensified. As Noll points out, the Civil War caused many churches to fission into southern and northern branches, based upon their beliefs in slavery. Northern churches tended to favor an interpretation-based view of the Bible, while Southern churches stuck with a much more literal interpretation of the Bible. Forex, since the Bible refers to slavery and the proper treatment of slaves, it must be appropriate to have slavery in the United States, they argued.

This literalist philosophy was later applied to things as varied as racial segregation, abortion, and global warming. Because of its reliance upon scripture as the absolute (literally Gospel) truth, anything that took a different viewpoint was seen in a dim light.",2017-01-03 06:17:24,dbxofi6,2145.0,The_Alaskan,AskHistorians

"I'm going to be very blunt, get an abortion. You're only 15. You're body is still growing. Pregnancy causes your body to go through all kinds of changes. You don't need to be going through that at the same time as puberty. I don't think there's any way to get an abortion without your parents finding out at your age. Of course, if you thought you were ready for sex you should have thought about the possibility your parents might find out. If you're not mature enough to have a conversation with your parents about sex you shouldn't have done it. I really don't think your parents will love you any less when they find out. They'll probably be disappointed, but I'm sure they'll always care about you. They'll just want what's best for you. Plus, if you don't get an abortion they''ll find out you had sex anyway when you start to become noticeably pregnant. Also, what the fuck kind of friend pushes you to have sex with someone you don't know? There are so many ways to be more outgoing without hooking up with a random guy. He sounds like a terrible friend and a bad influence. You would probably be better off without him in your life.

My advice is to tell your parents exactly what happened. Let them know that you met somebody who pushed you to make an irresponsible decision and that despite your efforts to do it safely you think you still somehow got pregnant. Tell them you regret what you did, that you're going to stop hanging out with that guy, you're not going to have sex again until you're older and in a committed relationship, and that you would like to get rid of the baby before it does any damage to your body. This doesn't all have to be true, but well it should be and even if you do plan to behave differently they don't necessarily need to know that. You just want this to go as smoothly as possible.

EDIT: I didn't comment on point 4, but I should have. No, you don't *have* to tell the father. This is ultimately your decision as it is your body. You can tell him if you want to, but it will just cause more stress and you never know if he'll try to get you to make a different decision than the one you want for his own selfish reasons.  Tbh, I don't think he wants to be a father. He's a teenager and he hooked up with you from the Internet. I can't imagine he's a responsible person. Most teenage boys just want to get their dicks wet and leave. Tell him if you want, but I doubt he cares about you or the baby and his opinions really don't matter because he doesn't have to carry it.",2019-08-18 02:26:36,ex9w0f5,1.0,livipup,Advice

"So I would ask if you could have headphones one with either music of your choice or meditation/relaxation tracks. It can serve as a distraction. Another distraction that I use daily due to anxiety is I go through the alphabet naming movies. A is for Almost Famous B is for bride of Frankenstein. To make it harder so your brain really has to concentrate on it try doing it by genre like horror movies or rom coms (a is for alien...t is for twenty seven dresses). It sounds stupid but you’d be amazed at how quick you’re brain refocuses to what you’re forcing it to do. 

If you’re getting the surgical abortion please know that, at least for me, the cocktail of painkillers they gave me during the procedure had me so loopy all I cared about and remembered was talking to the nurse about my aunt who had a pair of police issue hand cuffs. Hopefully you experience the same psychological distance under the drugs too.

I’m so sorry you’re having a hard time with this. If you feel secure in your choice but are having a hard time with the logistics please know there is support, therapy, and a literal sisterhood of us who have been where you are. You are not alone.

"&gt;Why is rape acceptable as a reason for an abortion but doing everything right and yet still getting pregnant is not an acceptable reason, when both are unwanted?

The core difference is that in having sex one consented to the risk of pregnancy. Pregnancy was a known potential outcome of the actions the person engaged in, and therefore dealing with the pregnancy is a consequence the individual should have foreseen. 

In the case of rape, this is not the case and the analysis for some people changes. 

It's a question of the balance of harm, really. People who propound this view hold that:

1. Abortion is a bad thing
2. Rape is a bad thing
3. Carrying an unwanted pregnancy following a rape is a bad thing

"Did you ever read https://dl.wdl.org/14716/service/14716\_1.pdf John Lewis Burkhardt travels in Arabia early 1800s about visit to Mekka) btw. the author is Swiss so his real name is Johan Ludwig Burkhardt.

fragments:

P233 “As numbers of the public women reside at Shab Aamer, this quarter is not ranked among the most respectable in Mekka. Sherif Ghaleb imposed a regular. tax upon those females, and required an additional payment from such of them as, in the time of the pil-grilnage, followed the hadjys to Arafat. A similar tax is levied at Cairo, and in all the great provincial towns of Egypt. Mekka abounds with the frail sisterhood, whose num-bers are increased during the hadj by ad-venturers from foreign countries. They are somewhat more decorous than the public women in Egypt, and never appear in the streets without veils. Among them are many Abyssinian slaves, whose former masters, ac-cording to report, share the profits of their vocation. Some are slaves belonging to Mek-kawys.“



P342 ""Among the richer classes, it is considered shameful to sell a concubine slave. If she bears a child, and the master has not already four legally married wives, he takes her in matrimony ; if not, she remains in his house for life ; and in some instances the number of concubines is increased to several dozen, old and young. 
The middling and lower classes in Mekka are not so scrupulous as their superiors: they buy up young Abyssi-nians on speculation ; educate them in the family ; teach them cooking, sewing, &amp;c.; and then sell them at a profit to foreigners, at least such as prove barren. I have been informed by physicians, barbers, and drug-gists, that the practice of causing abortion is frequent here. The seed of the tree which produces the balsam of Mekka, is the drug commonly used for this purpose."".

So because of all the travellers (and many of them expected to be cleansed of their sins,) prostitution was a major industry. That is probably still true to some extent.",2021-07-08 10:10:30,h4ghmhu,10.0,Ohana_is_family,exmuslim
"I'm not the person you're responding to, but a fetus is definitely a living organism and definitely human. It's definitely a human life. Abortion ends a human life.  

Everything above is completely nondebatable.  Where the debate comes in is that many people think that being a living human organism isn't enough to give a being a right to continue to live, and they like to define other points - formation of the nervous system etc. - where that right is conferred.

The issue with almost all of these points from a scientific standpoint is that they're fuzzy points - it's not like a fetus waffles around for a while and completely does not have a nervous system at 12:59pm and then gets its act together and presto nervous system at 1pm.

The one point for which this isn't an issue (aside from conception) is birth. However, birth carries the additional issue of being *after* most of the fuzzy points where people like to confer rights (beating heart, formation of nervous system, capable of independent action and movement).

From a scientific standpoint, the way most pro-choice advocates consider personhood is ridiculous and gut-based. However, considering personhood to begin at the first inarguable point (conception) is hugely inconvenient, and considering it to begin at the second (birth) doesn't pass the gut check for most people.",2012-06-10 12:20:57,c4ynm55,-1.0,Zifna,AskReddit

"You’re misunderstanding how US federal and state law interact, which is understandable. I’m not an expert on the law in Denmark either. There is no state in the US currently enforcing an abortion ban. The Supreme Court of the United States has held in at least two cases that the federal constitution protects a woman’s right to choose an abortion prior to viability. The Casey decision I think is the most recent:

https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-744

Because federal law supersedes state law when there is a conflict, a state passing a law directly contrary to a Supreme Court decision interpreting the federal constitution is basically passing a law that cannot be enforced. Various rights groups file an injunction or prohibition against enforcing the law, and then the law is struck down. This is what happened in Kentucky and Iowa and what will happen in Alabama:

I ran out to the home brew supply and bought some yeast starter. When trying to get the airlock out I somehow managed to push the plug through and into my wort. So..the only thing I could think of was a coat hanger. Ifashioned a hook at one end and went fishing in the wort. After a dozen tries I finnally extracted the plug from the carboy.
 Because of the use of a coathanger, I named that batch ""Abortion Ale"". Good thing it was only a one time deal. The yeast starter got it going for another week. It still smelled funny. And it ended up tasting less than OK. I drank it all however, not enthusiastically.

"It’s so infuriating. 

Having been born and raised in a conservative environment (albeit Canadian conservatives), it was quite an adjustment as I became old enough to start thinking for myself. To this day I still struggle with reconciling the world “as it should be” and the world as it truly is. It’s not pleasant. 

I am pro life, in other words, I believe in preserving human life. I don’t think anyone *wants* an abortion for the fun of it, but rather find themselves in circumstances that make it the best option available.
When I would start talking to people in my community about it, it’s as though they aren’t even capable of processing logical thought. 

Ultimately, pro life and pro choice people want the same thing. **Less unwanted pregnancies.** But when I tell them that they should instead advocate for better sex ed programs, free birth control and a robust foster system that isn’t corrupted to all hell (that’s another story) and easier access to adoption to maximize the options for mothers unwilling to keep the baby, they ignore it and say “it’s murder” or “but who will pay for all that” not realizing the social cost of unwanted pregnancies will always cost them more in the long run. 

I wish everything didn’t have to be a bipartisan issue. I know plenty of people here who vote on single issues like abortion, ignoring both the other policy proposals and the fact that regardless of who is in power, Canada isn’t going to ban abortions ever (save for radical shift towards religion, if it ever happened). 

It makes me sad to see young mothers have to turn to abortion and I wish I could give them another option. But the way to fix that isn’t to punish people. 

We have the money and the technology necessary to make everyone happier and better off. It’s the people that are working against their own interests because of misinformation, ignorance and preconceived notions, as well as indoctrination.

Sentience (the ability to feel) makes sense, based on the principle that we shouldn't cause sentient things to suffer.

"Many girls  (self-proclaimed feminists) where I live whine about having fewer rights then men. I live in a place where women CLEARLY have more rights and advantages than men. (I'm a girl btw.)

Small perks of being female: 

-Men hold doors open for me. 

-Men offer to lift heavy things for me. 

-Most men pay for the meal/movie/date. 

-When I have more guests over than seats, a guy will stand up and offer me his chair (but doesn't do that for my boyfriend who also lives here). 

-People don't want me to walk home alone after work, they want to drive me. They do these things simply because I'm a girl. It's not necessary, but I appreciate it.


Bigger issues:

-If I get pregnant,  I can have an abortion. If my boyfriend doesn't like that, too bad for him I guess? (Obviously it has to be this way because it's the woman's body, but the man has no rights in this case. )

-If I get pregnant and decide I don't want it,  I'm seen by the feminist community as a strong woman who made a tough choice and I have every right to get an abortion. If a man decides he doesn't want his child- he's a deadbeat lowlife scum to that same group of women.

-Guess who usually wins in child custody battles?  Mommy.

-If I physically attack a man when we are alone, and he retaliates by beating the shit out of me, there's a good chance that I can go cry that he attacked me first and he will get jail time. 

-Women can have sex with a man, and report it as rape if they regret it later. It's a fucking insult to real victims of sexual assault and false reports have happened many times.  If a man gets assaulted by a woman, whether its physically,  sexually,  or emotionally- he gets laughed at.

Thus, this appears a *lie of omission* bill which would reduce information and healthcare transparency relayed to the pregnant woman.

"&gt;This is not eugenics. Definition is: ""the belief and practice of improving the genetic quality of the human population.""

Do you really want to nitpick that much? For goodness sake a ""practice of improving the genetic quality of the human population"" could also be improving or changing the food quality for a nation. That affects the population on a massive scale.

I like the Oxford Definition: ""the science of improving a human population by controlled breeding to increase the occurrence of desirable heritable characteristics.""

Obviously abortion allows for individually controlled breeding and the bulk of the argument could be 'heritable characteristics' could be taken as purely genetic but genetic or socioeconomic (you inheriting the wealth and economic conditions of your parents, etc). Obviously the importance of abortion is to make sure a woman doesn't feel burdened by childbirth when she is not feeling like she's capable of taking care of it, thus allowing for controlled births of children in poor economic conditions, improving the quality of the human population.

I'd argue it is eugenics but if you don't want to call it that, what would you call ""the science of improving a human population by controlled breeding to increase the occurrence of desirable economic characteristics.""?

In other words, the male is an incomplete female, a walking abortion, aborted at the gene stage. To be male is to be deficient, emotionally limited; maleness is a deficiency disease and males are emotional cripples.

"Forcing anyone to do something they don't want with their own body is backwards.  You can't force someone to donate a kidney to keep someone else alive.  You also can't force women to be pregnant.  Just because some of these uneducated fucks don't understand basic human biology doesn't mean that they have to the right to force women to give birth.  A newly fertilized egg is not a person and a lot more pregnancies end in miscarriage than we even know.  It's a natural process.  There is no pain or suffering because an embryo isn't developed enough - the concept doesn't exist.  Most abortions are performed during this time.  

&gt;The majority of abortions in 2015 took place early in gestation: 91.1% of abortions were performed at ≤13 weeks’ gestation; a smaller number of abortions (7.6%) were performed at 14–20 weeks’ gestation, and even fewer (1.3%) were performed at ≥21 weeks’ gestation.

https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm  

The abortions performed later in pregnancy are usually incredibly emotional and difficult decisions for the parents where the fetus has some horrible defect which cause suffering for the rest of the child's life or death upon birth.  Forcing a fetus to endure pain only to die when birthed is backwards.  Forcing parents to carry a dead on arrival child is backwards.  It's cruel.  

There are many more points of discussion (denial of financial aid to young mothers, lack of health insurance, low income, health (or life) risks to the mother, the physical and mental tolls of pregnancy itself...) but those really aren't the point.

"&gt; Because it assumes that the child was carried to term and responsibility was already accepted for that child's birth.

The point of this thread was that a man who engages in sex is morally and legally responsible for the consequences of the sex. If the woman gets pregnant and decides to keep the baby he has a responsibility to support that child, whether he took precautions or not. Engaging in sex carried enough of a foreseeable risk of pregnancy to hold him accountable. Why that is applicable is obvious.

&gt; The injured party does not have the right to compel you to give them lifesaving support even though you cause their predicament. 

Sure, but if they die or sustain more serious damages as a result of their injuries you didn't help with you are still responsible for the severity of those injuries/death. 

And this analogy is spreading thin in regards to actual abortion, since I already made a distinction between being forced to *start* supporting someones health (in the case you are discussing) and being responsible for making them dependent on your support and then opting to *stop* supporting them. That was at the beginning of the discussion, and it is fairly unique to abortion.

"&gt; Never said it did. That is why medical self-defense exceptions exist in most pro-life legislation.

Except that's not how the right to justified homicide is determined. You don't get to say ""sorry buddy, your right not to bleed a quart of blood out of your vagina is denied because you appear to be too healthy right now."" 

**If it wasn't a fetus, it would be very clear how wrong that is.**

&gt;I think the idea of consent is over-used in this debate. When someone gets pregnant, consent is meaningless. The child is there. It is a human being, and doesn't require anyone's consent to exist.

Wow yeah, this is exactly what I'm talking about. If it wasn't a fetus the right to consent would not and  never be meaningless, because any other alive viable person would not get to live at the expense of another person's right to be safe and healthy and not injured, disabled or dead. 

You see how if it wasn't a pregnancy, and it was just you using my organs without my consent, I would have the right to kill you because my consent is absolute. Why does pregnancy change the rules? 

&gt;Gain or loss of consent is also not always considered to always have immediate effect.

That's not true with regards to legally abiding persons. Is sex a crime against a fetus? Is pregnancy a crime against a fetus? My consent is absolute even if it was my own born child who I had a duty of care to. 

&gt;The mother would have to take a specific action to kill the child

This is incorrect as well. Justified homicide is always a specific action and is legal after a withdrawl of consent. You don't seem to understand or respect that women deserve these equal rights, as you claim you did. 

&gt;In many legal situations, consent can be withdrawn, but vacation of premises or other actions on the part of the deprived party usually take into account the circumstances. You can't simply evict someone for non-payment of rent without due process. 

**Women are people, not premises or property.**

See this is what I mean. You have to treat women like property in order for you to demand a fetus has a superior right to live over her own self protection. 

Does anyone EVER have to get an eviction permission from a court of law for their own body?

Really? 

Do you tell your kids that (if you have them)?

&gt;And even Roe v. Wade makes this point. The case states merely that the state can't forbid abortion because the state has no interest before ""viability"". That suggests that legally, the state is not bound by the principle of the woman's consent after a certain point.

And after viability it is legal as long as there is a medical reason, which btw, includes all the reasons anyone would ever have to say no to a 100% chance of losing 500 ml to a quart of blood, or more. 

It also specifies that pregnant people are granted the same due process rights as all other groups, which means no one can be subject to have to petition for their rights (including being a witness against themselves) while being under physical duress. As in, what pregnancy factually is. A physical imposition.

So before you make claims about what it does and doesn't suggest please make sure you know what you are talking about. 

&gt;We would simply argue that the state interest extends back to conception due to the loss of human rights of the child.

Except not even parents with a duty of care of born children have to petition for their rights not to be harmed and immediately threatened physically by their own child, while being harmed and immediately threatened physically by their own child. 

So no. 

You are demanding that pregnant women be treated as physical objects, not persons, with reduced rights to due process, self defense, liberty and consent that no other group ever has to be subject to. 

&gt;. I disagree with your opinion about human beings not inherently having human rights.

You have misread my words completely. Read what I said. It is you who is declaring that pregnant women don't have the same universal rights as everyone else. 

&gt;What makes rape worse than delivery has nothing to do with how much blood is spilled in the process. That's a terrible comparison.

A doctor cutting up a woman's body against her will as she's screaming no is arguably worse than rape. But I'm not making any kind of direct comparison as only a fool would ever try to say one trauma is worse than another. One rape worse than another.


BTW, this is the definition of rape: 

&gt;Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.

https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/violent-crime/rape

Note it does not have to be for sexual purposes and it does not have to be a penis.

So actually a doctor inserting his hands or a knife inside a woman's vagina in order to extract a baby from her, without her consent, is rape. 

So yes, some forced births are in fact, active rape, and it is a correct comparison.  

&gt;That is why there are medical exceptions to anti-abortion laws in the event of danger to the mother's life.

Self defense is not denied from people based on them not being ""close to death enough.""

"&gt; People wouldn't vote for Bernie for the same reasons they didnt vote for Hillary

Considering the biggest stumbling block for Hillary was corruption, past scandals, lack of transparency, and apathy from voters...I'd say thats definitively not the case. Bernie is pro guns, gays god and abortion didn't really factor into things this time around. He was never going to get red votes, just as Clinton didn't. But he would (and did) have pulled in a TON of moderates. The same moderates that went Trump because they didn't like Clinton. 

&gt;Lets stop pretending he had a chance. 

Considering his lead in the polls vs Trump was about 10 points higher than Clinton, no, I'm not going to ""stop pretending"".

"“A rather dangerous subgroup.”

Are you referring to adoptees? Because 135,000 children are adopted in the US every year... I’m sorry, but this is a lurid way to argue your point with some legitimately horrendous implications. You’re using 0.004% of a demographic to make a point, and that’s not even out of all children fostered yearly, just the ones that are legally adopted. That’s even assuming that there are 500 NEW serial killers every year and absolutely ALL of them were adopted... which isn’t the case... so the actual percentage is even lower than that minute faction.

What makes this totally disturbing to me is, not only how you equate a (potential) .004% of a demographic to being representative of that demographic... but also to abortion... are you saying abortion solves that? You don’t see a problem with that mentality? Is your assertion that it is entirely acceptable to say to that 99.996% of adoptees that it would have been better if they would have died in the womb?

That’s stunning to me... Truly stunning. Maybe that’s not your honest point, but the logic is certainly there and just isn’t even remotely acceptable to me.

Why should we trust a deity -- that for all intents and purposes does not exist -- to tell us what is ""good"" and what is ""evil""? Especially when the deity's own words prove it is a terrible beast, infatuated with slaughter, death and cruelty.",2019-11-17 05:09:20,f7qp3kw,1.0,pauz43,DebateReligion

"Thanks for what seems like your genuine interest in my perspective, even though I suspect that you will disagree with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My views on abortion are, I think, pretty simple. The foundation of my perspective centers around the question ""What are the unborn?"" 

If the unborn are nothing more than a clump of cells than abortion should be legal in all circumstances. Abortion would certainly be akin to any surgical procedure. There would be nothing to argue about. 

However, if the unborn are human then abortion would never be acceptable. I'm sincerely interested in hearing any perspective on abortion and am willing to honestly listen and try to understand things from another perspective. 

I have never made a religious argument for abortion, which for obvious reasons would be ineffective for changing the cultural views on the issue. For me it comes down to science. The unborn are a unique and self-directed human organism. You and I were both a fetus at one point, because being a fetus is one stage of human development, as is being a toddler or elderly.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone reading this is sincerely interested in a charitable and thoughtful discussion I would welcome that. I'm not interested in discussing this with anyone who seems interested only in speaking (that would be a waste of time).",2019-05-19 15:58:45,eo4ntbh,15.0,MoralVolta,vegan

"I just came home from a date with a very sweet and very respectful man who is closer to my age, too (he’s 41 and not 59 like my PA boyfriend). I’m 27.

I might run this guy away because the whole time during the date I am not present mentally at all; the entire time I’m thinking about my PA boyfriend and why he keeps making excuses not to see me during the week anymore. All of a sudden my PA boyfriend is more busy at work and having to stay late after work. He doesn’t even text me as much as he used to anymore. Sometimes he’ll call to talk to me at night during the week but him calling at night doesn’t make me less suspicious because he stays up until 2:00AM and he used to come pick me up at 2:00AM in the morning so who knows he could be out there fucking around at wee hours of the morning when I’m asleep. And this is why I will never sleep with my PA boyfriend ever again because I do not want a disease. If he ever gave me a disease then I’d wish the worst to happen to him. 

I ignored my PA boyfriend’s text that he sent me saying something about how he can’t get out of some meeting early enough to come see me. Why all of a sudden he is needed more at work when he told me before that his job wants him to take more time off? Either he is lying and he forgot that he told me that.

The guy I was on a date with could tell that I was not really listening to what he was saying at all and I could tell that he knew I was in another world inside my head.

My date drove me home and gave me a big bear hug because I told him the pain I was going through during the date. And he said he wants to see me again. I don’t know if I even want to be in another relationship again. I’m just so emotionally exhausted.

I can’t even imagine falling in love with another man right now. I really think I give up. The relationship with my PA boyfriend and having that medical abortion after getting pregnant by my PA boyfriend has sucked the life out of my soul.....

I really do not think I care about being in a relationship anymore, especially since I feel so used up and worthless. I mean I’m already 27 and am about to make 28 next year. I wish I could just drop dead. I’m so tired.",2019-11-22 06:31:02,f8aoef5,1.0,AdAstra9191,loveafterporn
"&gt;Pro-lifers are against abortion because they view it as murder, which is illegal. 

Which is a much less justified belief than what AOC said. There is nothing uniquely human about an embryo when an abortion takes place other than DNA, and DNA does not mean life, which is why viruses aren't really considered alive. 

But the people who believe otherwise aren't going to be persuaded to change their views. What I think is more troubling is their ""solution"" to the problem to the abortion rather than their belief about what abortion represents. Because it is just as stupid as PETA members breaking into labs and releasing imprisoned animals to the wild where subsequently quickly die because they are domesticated animals. 

The fact is some ~30% of pregnancies naturally end in miscarriages, and you don't need a doctor for an abortion, just to perform one safely. So what happens when you illegalize abortion is that abortions just go underground, more women avoid OBGY services to hide their pregnancy, and they risk their lives to deal with the ""problem"" themselves. Every attempt to minimize abortion through bans actually increases the rate of abortion, and the best way to decrease [abortions is to provide legal avenues to get abortions](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/abortion-rates-go-down-when-countries-make-it-legal-report-n858476), as well as a host of other free health services, especially to women. 

And if someone understands that basic truth about abortion bans increases abortions and putting women's lives at risk and still thinks an abortion ban is something we should pursue, then AOC is right and that person is only interested in oppressing women, to punish them for their ""wicked behavior"". 

Regardless, I think the effects of abortion ban is the basic truth we should all know and agree on instead of the age when life should count as ""human"" life. Because if you understand the former correctly, then your answer to the latter shouldn't really matter.",2019-05-16 20:07:20,ent4ai8,0.0,ZhouDa,politics
"Warning ur gonna get pretty much roasted by the comments section because you aren’t Libertarian. In spite of this I’m going to attempt to answer your questions through a conservative lens (even though I’m pretty opposed to that way of thinking).

Personally I wouldn’t vote for Trump even if I was a conservative. His rhetoric is idiotic and he’s pretty much wiped his ass with the constitution. The guy was trying to suspend habeus corpus a few months ago I’m not sure he’s a great example of what American Conservatism should represent. As for Jorgensen’s positions I’ll say this: 

1) The abortion issue has largely been out of the national arena. I doubt a President will really actually touch that issue considering it’s so divisive. So what she says is pretty much irrelevant.

2) The military spends too much money. Let me reiterate that the military spends too much fucking money. A lot of it is pretty much wasted on developing new weapons that don’t come to fruition (padding the weapons contractors and politicians they lobby’s pockets). I also think we should have a strong military, spending trillions every year to blow up Arab children isn’t making us stronger; its weakening us significantly. There’s a reason why [Realists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(international_relations)) (a school that thinks states further their own power and security) haven’t supported any of the recent American wars.

3) People are going to come over anyways, if they actually want live in America and live the American dream then we should want them here. America is a nation of immigrants and making it so difficult to become a citizen disincentivizes people from actually applying themselves and assimilating.

What would I do if I was you? I’d reevaluate my positions and come to an informed decision. Voting for Jorgensen isn’t going to be a winning vote however so I guess ultimately the choice is yours on what you believe.

Personally I don’t vote in national elections because it’s irrelevant what I say and the Feds are going to do what they want anyways.",2020-07-28 23:15:47,fzkcif1,5.0,[deleted],AskLibertarians
"&gt; If you're in a relationship with someone you are seriously considering for a long-term relationship, abortion might not even show up as a possibility.

Ah, but he doesn't say ""might."" He says no one would advise it. That's absurd and shows just how incredibly ignorant he is about modern life. ",2018-04-06 17:33:00,dwxa22k,0.0,BloodsVsCrips,samharris
"&gt; We believe there are two humans present.

And, as I said, that's where it ends.  That doesn't justify your conclusions.  Science never will make that final leap, it is outside of its purview.

&gt;It is only the standard of care for the same reason...

Oh now that's the BS.  It's the standard of care because we won't stand to see our wives/mothers/etc be forced to die because they can't defend themselves against the aggressor here.  Because the abortion is necessary to save her life.

Because we find the idea that both must die because no treatment is allowed to be utterly evil, and not the good thing that you proclaim.

Are such cases rare, yes, but they certainly exist, and in time I believe the Catholic church will be forced out of the hospital business because of it.  At the very least I expect that they will not be allowed to be the only hospital in an area, and perhaps be forced to tell patients of the standard treatment options because the patient's right to life is more important than the hospital's freedom of religion.  I give that a 20 year or so timeframe, we'll see how wrong or right I am.

The arguments tend to appeal to negative emotions while being disguised as facts. It’s really insidious actually, but unfortunately it has all ready pierced the zeitgeist. 

One of amazing things I have found to be very helpful is doing with Socrates does and just turning around all of their responses into questions.

I just started coming up with canned questions to their questions.

Such as. 
When someone brings up the fact that abortion is against the Bible. You can bring up that the only mention of abortion in the Bible was how to perform one by a priest. After that you could just bring up the fact that the abortion bill is not about abortions but whether or not the government can tell you when or where you can have a baby. You know what conservatives hate is the government telling them what to do. With a response like that you could just cover both bases you can go “I don’t see you following the Bible and I don’t want the government telling me what to do” , and you can look at them and tell them hey I don’t know what their true motives are but they don’t sound like freedom or holy.

"I’m right wing and I don’t care about either. What I do care about is those same people pushing their ideals on someone else. Transgender people petitioning for kids to be put on hormone blockers and women who ruthlessly tore apart their baby, or with their approval, encouraging women who don’t want abortions to have them.

Hell, I have a buddy who’s daughter plays with toy cars. Just toys she enjoys. The teacher went up to him one day as he was picking her up from school and told him that since the girl plays with cars, she should be out on hormone blockers. I’m surprised he didn’t dislocate that bitches jaw. Nobody should dictate what kids should have to do with their bodies especially when it comes to something as important as endocrinology during development.

Secondly, women are encouraged by msm to get abortions as a first option, skipping beyond considering adoption and other options for taking care of the child. Hell, I was put up for adoption by my birth mother Cus she couldn’t take care of me, and I gotta say, I much prefer being alive and not dead.

"&gt;If government is a monopoly on the use of force, then regardless of the organization of state, wouldn't anyone who wanted to ""compel change"" not necessarily try to utilize that monopoly on force for their own ends? Even if it is for our own good?

This is an interesting question of the chicken or the egg. Is government a creation of the people that is merely wrongly utilized to serve other ""special interests"" or is the government a product of those ""special interests."" If you look at Lysander Spooner's essay No Authority, the constitution is clearly not a voluntary agreement arising out of ""the people"", but one that is initiated by a select group of men who made it law of the land- to the extent that the scope of government has continually expanded since the constitution became law, this again is a product of special interests, not ""the people."" 

The state as some kind of separate, abstract entity that merely ""exists"" as an ultimate given isn't a very fruitful way of framing the question- rather, who/what are the progenitors of the state? Well, I contend the state exists *for* the special interests alone. 

&gt;Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.

Note the oft-heard argument by the coarser variety of leftists: ""you're just a greedy, selfish minority-baby eating monster."" They then proceed to ""regulate"" that greed with wealth redistribution. I think it's a rather untenable argument but I can't help but think socialism is merely driven by envy- a variation of greed which they so despise.

"Of course I don’t want to force abortions or sterilization. I don’t want to criminalize doing hard drugs or extreme BDSM either, doesn’t mean I have to respect the choice to get high or get choked unconscious.

Pregnancy apologism/glorification ensures that artificial wombs will never be seen as necessary. It helps disguise the horror of forced birth, since growing parasites in people who are then totally helpless while their vaginas are used isn’t considered that bad. It emotionally manipulates women into keeping pregnancies or raising children they wouldn’t otherwise. So yes, the choice to bear a child and especially to talk about it like it’s positive thing rather than just personally enjoyable does affect others.

&gt; stop talking about pregnancy like it’s slavery

It is a kind of bondage. Even the most pro-choice women in the most reproductively liberal countries won’t be able to avoid giving birth later in pregnancy. And when they do give birth, they can’t stop it. Inevitably they lose the ability to choose whether their bodies are used.

&gt; loosen up

Thanks, but this issue is important to me. I can’t stand by and watch half of humanity be exploited or told that their losing their most basic freedom and dignity is okay.

Yes, women can perpetuate the patriarchy. And liberal women point out this hypocrisy all the time. But cis men—by virtue of generally being the main beneficiaries of the patriarchy and the ones who will suffer the least blow black from restrictive abortion laws—have also disproportionately controlled the political culture that allows these laws to thrive.

"No, I don't think it's the same. But all efforts should be made to retain life. If you're artificially stopping it by killing an otherwise healthy baby while still in the womb, that's different. That's murder. 

But to follow your logic, would you support the legal abortion date be on a sliding scale? So if it's 16 weeks now, but next week a new technological innovation comes out that allows for viability at 15 weeks, would you be ok with restricting abortion at 15 weeks?

My general point is, we're talking about potentially killing babies. If we aren't 100% sure about whether we have it right, the default position should be ""It's illegal outside of incest, rape and threat of death to the mother"".

"Colorado specifically I know just off the top of my head unless the law has changed in the last year is one of the states where both parents must be informed beforehand for it to be legal (that is why women in utah etc can’t just drive off to Colorado and abort thankfully) this “any reason at all” flippant statement is still inaccurate and I suspect prompted due to having an emotional reaction - I can understand that because it’s upsetting it really is but don’t let emotions get in the way of seeing things rationally. 

Plus Attempting to appeal to only people’s emotions who may or may not feel the same way as you is one of the things holding most of the pro life movement back honestly especially since supporting women will always be the primary thing that keeps women from even considering abortions at all! *Especially* considering the fact that among Catholics specifically the most likely to get an abortion are mothers who already have children but can’t financially support more, this is well documented.

"&gt;Stating that a fertilised egg results in an adult barring unfortunate incidents is implying that anything which prevents full term growth as unfortunate


I do tend to take the view that a human life ending prematurely is unfortunate, you got me there.



&gt; is also full of holes, pregnancy because of forgetting to take a daily contraceptive isn't destined to be a person because that person will continue to take contraceptives without evening realising fertilisation happened.


That's not how contraceptives work. If a woman's egg gets fertilized due to forgetting to take a contraceptive, more contraceptives will not prevent the pregnancy from continuing. Regardless this really has little to do with the topic.


&gt;Someone who is physically active has a high chance of miscarriage without even knowing that one took place.


That doesn't affect my argument at all.


&gt;Lastly getting an abortion isn't an unfortunate incident.


That's your opinion, I don't share it.


&gt;Regarding your last sentence saying a fertilised egg is a human, there isn't a definition of human that could possibly encompass both an adult human and a fertilised egg and still be a useful definition.
