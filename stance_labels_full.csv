"I agree that it's coming either way, but for many minimum wage jobs the tech already exists to replace them. As an example, think anyone working cash registers or taking orders in fast casual eateries. The majority of those people could be replaced today, but for many smaller shops and franchises it's easier to just get a few minimum wage folks than to invest in a functional automated system. There has to be some threshold where people are willing to not automate because the breakeven on an automated system doesn't make sense yet. 

I honestly don't know what the right level is for minimum wage, as I think cost of living should be taken into account. $15 an hour in bumblefuck flyover country is much different from $15 in asshole coastal country. 

Realistically UBI needs to be in the discussion in addition to or even instead of higher minimum wage. As you said automation is coming and not just for blue collar jobs.

So by decreasing the work week whilst guaranteeing a basic income, to take the strain off the job market. Instead of competing against AI, we just transition the human economy whilst taxing the AI/robot economy to pay for it. 

It's very simple. We just have to accept that there is a finite amount of work to be done, and as robots and AI do it, we need to find other things to do.

"If I try to look at the problem on the country's economy scale, what you really need is to have three times the economic output you have today to make enough resources for the UBI.

"&gt; believing everyone who doesn’t do it your way is a loser 

I don't think this. People can do whatever they like. What I am saying is people have options to succeed in life rather than expecting the government to intervene.

&gt; Except I don’t think people should just sit back and wait for government aid, but I also don’t think it’s solely up to you whether you succeed. 

I agree with this. It's not solely up to you; you have to find opportunity in markets/industries that are growing or are in demand. Obviously if the entire economy falls apart its going to be more difficult, but there are always options, and every big change in the economy will also open doors. For example, retail jobs are in dire straits until the rona is over, but ecommerce opportunities are booming because people are buying shit online like crazy.

Look, I'm not trying to speak in absolutes here. I am a classical liberal to a large degree but I'm not going to sit here and argue that socializing certain things is bad. I have no problem with primary education, fire depts, etc. Hell, if we did not have farm subsidies we would not have farmers... or food. I also don't want to do shit like eliminate the EPA or FDA, as inept as both of them are. 

What I am saying is that people always have opportunities to start careers or learn skills that are in demand. I wasn't given any opportunities that anyone else doesn't have. No one dropped a career on my lap- I made it happen while I was working in food service. People have the power to change their situation RIGHT NOW instead of waiting for the government to manipulate industries or increasing min wage which would just cause inflation and the elimination of jobs and small biz.

Now, where I think you and I can find some common ground is that I think instead of pushing kids into college we should be pushing them into trades and skills like coding or ecommerce. I am much more interested in giving people the tools to learn how to succeed outside of the dying college -&gt; career trajectory, and if the government wants to put money into that instead of bloated public colleges or UBI or entitlements I am all for it.

"&gt;Well backing from the communist party, 

I'm not sure we can blame Corbyn for the actions of a party he has no influence in. Sure, it may be telling about how the Communist Party feel about Corbyn but that doesn't mean much. People often align with entities they shouldn't. 

&gt;not denouncing the ira 

I'm pretty sure he has done this. Supporting Irish nationalism is not the same as supporting the IRA. 

&gt;and having appeared on terrorist backed propaganda TV channels for money in Iran might have something to do with it. 

Gonna have to explain this one. Never heard of this. Got any good articles to learn?

&gt;Along with open borders and his new one of universal income. ( look into scandanavia too see how both of those are going)

Not sure how scandanavia represents open borders, if i ever heard Corbyn support such a thing (he is famously anti EU) or if he has ever fielded UBI. I am admittedly ignorant on those points. 

&gt;It's not really difficault to work out that if communists and terrorists are backing someone then it's probably a bad bet. They're backing him because it serves their cause not ours.

Communists are such a small demographic almost anywhere in the world I don't think I need to worry about those with Stalinist inclinations. As for terrorists, well they're everywhere. And the definition shifts with perspective. I don't condone terrorism. But I understand how it manifests and that is not in a vaccuum. Terrorism is created. The answer is to change the environment that people live in so that they have a basic level of care, income, sustainability and freedom. Lofty? Sure. But admirable.

That's Corbyn's view. To create a world were people don't have to resort to violent, terrorist tactics. They're free, healthy and not starving. They've a community and a place in it. It may be naive, but it is noble.

I'm no fan of Corbyn. I think he's a bit of a spineless hack. But I admire his vision and his convinction in not backing down in the face of tyranny.

"I had been slightly curious myself, so I looked into this.  This is my brief conclusion of what MMT is:

MMT is a way of looking at Government issued Currency and Government Debt in a way that matches up with reality, rather than the way a lot of us think of Government issued Currency and Government Debt.  A lot of us have wrong perceptions about these economic subjects of study, much of it caused by the sales and marketing that is Neo-Classical economics, and these wrong perceptions being so pervasive throughout our media, and our culture.  MMT proponents are trying to dispel these wrong perceptions that a lot of us have about Government issued Currency and Debt.

There are a multitude of government programs we could create, using the power of government, to help all of us that are struggling financially right now.  We could ensure everyone of us a home, food, health care, education, and employment/basic income.  Once enough of us realize this is the truth, it will be more difficult for those ""in charge"" to get us to believe otherwise. 

From more of Marx/Dialectical Cosmic viewpoint, MMT isn't going to save the capitalist system from it's inevitable collapse (there's too many counter-forces coming right at it, some immensely good, some more non-comfortable), but it can help us dispel wrong perceptions about Government Currency and Debt, and can help lead our collective selves to a place where we can more clearly see how to ease some of our suffering, until capitalism has finally passed.

Here's a link to a series of good videos exploring MMT more in depth:

[https://www.youtube.com/user/ModMonPubPurpose/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/ModMonPubPurpose/videos)

C) Taking race out of the equation, there are plenty of people in the US that are against Free Speech in the US. SJWs, man. Even still, that's a very small minority with very little influence.

D) Educating an individual and showing them how great this country is more effective, if we're expressing opinion here. Showing them and their children that we're tolerant and respectable people is more effective than sending them back with their shit in their hands, if anything, that's going to make them even more pissed off. If we're good to them, we become less of a target. The problem is, this country isn't that great, and we're facing a bleak future of automation, unemployment, and eventually violence. Corporations aren't going to pay for basic income if our jobs are replaced. We've created a perpetual war in the middle east that I'm not sure we want to end.

"With regards to the economic system, do you propose people are paid based on the effort they put in, rather than the value they create? Because tbh that’s largely what our employment situation is, people are paid basically for their costs, plus or minus $50k (90% of people fall within the $30-130k range). Both situations are essentially indentured servitude, even if the clothes are nicer at the top of that range... there is 40 years of hard labor before a rest.

Billionaires live outside that realm of getting paid to cover your costs, they get paid based on value captured, which can either be from wealth created or wealth taken (think gamblers vs carpenters). The PC create a lot of wealth through massive improvements in productivity. Coca Cola imo are largely takers of wealth, they provide a brief bit of happiness one could argue, but I hate soda and what it does to people and people are happily departing with their money for nothing of real value.

The real issue to me are the takers. This includes financial industries, superfluous jobs, and people who’s job it is to transfer money from one person to another. The makers are people who build things, systems, tools, are actually providing solutions when they do sales. These things valuable to society and should be appreciated

To what extent is a different story, should a billionaire have as much as they do? Well, it’s hard to place a limit on things, and capital tends to accumulate which is both a blessing and a curse, it’s given us the whole quality of life improvements seen over the last 500 years. It absolutely has not given us the poverty and suffering we have today, that came standard, long before any of this.

Take care of student debt and tuition, give us free healthcare, and provide a basic UBI to give employees some leverage in hiring negotiations, tax the rich a fair bit more and get rid of loopholes. That’s all great and reasonable.

But it’s still the same system, and that will be okay because the system we have actually does a lot of work for us quite well, it’s just hard to remember that iPhones and trains and airplanes and everything aren’t normal at all, we’ve gotta build stuff, and capitalism allows that to happen like no other system.

It's likely that, with UBI, hourly wages for essential work would go up.

Create an environment in which working is truly voluntary and, while the majority of people will, they'll be able to do so for fairer wages and on better terms.

Haha yeah, I just saw a jumping-off point to expand on what you were leaving unsaid, and I just so happened to have this soapbox with me...

Let's just be a big pile of salt together, haha.

Sorry to hear you're stuck in the same bullshit creativity-killing situation.  There's tons of us and it's fucking miserable, no matter which artistic pursuit it is you're after.  But hey, that's just the way it is!!!!!!!!! &lt;-- the thing we are probably all  sick of hearing

The worst part is that it doesn't have to be this way.  Like you said, your job is extremely inefficient.  They probably don't *actually* need someone there to do it, they could just as easily task another staff member with handling emergencies as they come up along with their regular duties.  So many people work pointless nothing-jobs because ""that's just the way it is"", you gotta work to survive and survive to work and anything else makes you a drain on society.  But it's only like this because we decided it has to be like this.  We could just as easily decide that 20 hours should be a full work week for a livable wage, or to give everyone a universal basic income so they only work if they need/want to work, or a million other ways to make it so that you don't have to dedicate your entire life to work just to feed your family.

We mock the starving artist who quits his job to be in a band, but if he hits it big then suddenly we all love him and his story is an inspirational tale of following your dreams no matter what.  It's like there's this glass ceiling that's three feet thick, and you have to chisel your way through it one tiny chip at a time whenever you get the chance to climb up there and do it, and the one guy who managed to get lucky and find a weak point to burst his way through gets held up as an example of how anyone can do it if they just try hard enough!  But not you, god, don't you know that shit's 3 feet thick?  You'll never make it through there, just stop wasting your time and get back to work already.  There's zero self-awareness of the paradox here, and when I try to talk to most people about it there's just this complete mental block of being able to wrap their heads around the idea that the axiom doesn't have to be what we made it.

And even if it's not a matter of not being able to make money as an artist, even if it's just ""man I'd rather be fishing right now,"" why is that so bad?  Why is it wrong for people to want to live the lives that fulfill them?  Why is self-enrichment not more valuable than generating profits for someone else?  Why should you have to wait 65+ years until you can retire - if you can even afford to - to finally be able to spend your life the way you wanted to spend it all along?

&gt; It might lead one to believe, from a paranoid Hegelian perspective that this is deliberate to keep the arts suppressed and from transforming the whole of society in a way that is untenable to the powers that be.

Frankly, I think that's exactly the answer to my last paragraph.  Anything that doesn't generate profits, anything that makes people question their place as a cog in the machine, anything that would endanger the precariously balanced system in any way must be suppressed.  The last thing they want is a bunch of free-thinkers spreading ideas around and showing all the miserable wage-slaves that there is in fact a state of existence outside of misery and that everyone has a right to it.

I mean it's not exactly *1984* style direct suppression here; they just built the system bit by bit in such a way that its very structure self-enforces the cycle.  It's very insidious.

"Maybe you should of read the article before proclaiming people to be ridiculous.

Basic income is not for everyone. Anyone who is not working or can't work. Unlike welfare or unemployment insurance that ends after so long or only applies in specific conditions basic income means people put of work at the time.

Regardless as the article suggests and says 10% are unemployed. It does add confusion when it says 23% of youths are unemployed. This simply means of the total population including youths it's 10 percent. Of just youths it's 23%.

So 500,000 people need basic income. Not 5.5 million. Even at 1000 a month that equals 6 billion a year.

Moreover you used some shady tactics to get your 54 bill estimate. First you showed 14 and up is 83% of the population then instead of calculating cost at 4.5 mill you calculated it at 5.5 roughly.

So that's actually 450,000 people or around 5 billion.

This change would also restructure government programs rendering the need for huge money sinks to be eleminated. 

In the end whether this program did or did not cost more really doesn't matter because we face a harsh reality soon. There will be no work. Think even a doctor is safe?

"On it's face, I agree that it's silly, but it's more likely the reaction from business' who would replace the work force with more efficient automation. Many business' have responded to proposed min. wage raises with 
preferences for replacing labor rather than complementing their workforce, potentially creating large-scale unemployment with less job opportunities in other sectors (as A.I. is projected to extended into more sectors than machines did during the industrial revolution) and creating a much larger lower class.

I'm under the impression that UBI's success is 100% speculative since success relies on a perpetually strong capital income from those being taxed to pay for it. This would hypothetically work if A.I. meets our expectations, but we're still in the early stages of the ubiquitous A.I. roll-out and it's possible that UBI (under a capital gains tax) wouldn't realistically manifest until after Yang's terms were up anyway. That said, the trajectory toward that A.I. roll-out is often a result of fiscal conservation during recessions and downturns. Ideally, as these downturns happen and companies up-skill their labor force (causing laborers without new training to lose out to newer competitors), they invest in A.I. that protects their overhead and increases their capital. That increased capital may be enough to get taxed for UBI.

The problem with all these arguments over UBI is that it relies on A.I. to produce enough goods that can be bought cheaply, or at least exported to other nations, by populations who can afford those goods. AFAIK, we don't have a large enough automated workforce to meet the capital needs of UBI. We may get closer with each recession/downturn, but then we usually get more mouths to feed too.

"&gt;The article doesn't contain the word 'emergency'.

It embeds a facebook post that Dalio made, ala:

&gt;I got a good question about how the proliferation of AI and algorithmic decision making will affect jobs and about the possibility of universal basic incomes eventually impacting humans’ ability to continue to derive meaning and self-purpose from work. My view is that algorithmic/automated decision making is a two edged sword that is improving total productivity but is also eliminating jobs, leading to big wealth and opportunity gaps and populism, and creating a national emergency. Largely as a result of it, capitalism is not working for the majority of Americans and is in jeopardy. Yet no one is seriously examining what to do about it.

&gt;I don’t believe that transferring money to people who are unproductive is good for the people or the economy, unless there are no other good alternatives. I believe that it’s both far better and it’s possible to find ways for making most of these people productive. **I think that a national emergency should be declared**, a special commission created, and metrics established to come up with programs and measurements to make work improvements that more than pay for themselves and measure the changes that are taking place. I know of many cost effective ways that improvements that pay for themselves can be made and I’m sure that many others know of many more ways.

&gt;Productivity is good for everyone. Unfortunately, it’s not available to everyone. That has to change. We need leadership that can bring that about. Unfortunately, it is more likely that nothing along these lines will be done and, in the next economic downturn, the haves and have nots will be at each other’s’ throats, fighting over income redistributions rather than working together to make plans to make most people productive. For that reason, I’m worried about the health of capitalism and democracy.

&gt;In any case, the idea that automation is the 'emergency' (short of an actual Skynet-like robot rebellion) is completely misleading.

“If the goal is to have everyone employed digging trenches, why not give them spoons instead of shovels?

Well, part of the argument is that UBI is necessary already because of the effect automation and globalization has had on suppressing wages.

I suppose your point about global competition in terms of tax leverage very well may be an issue- 

However, economists predict a $.8 Trillion GDP growth due to a massive increase in consumer spending.

Whatever people are paying in contract rent, they are going to get back the location premium in public goods and/or a UBI.

The move from the farm to the factory was a move from physical labour to cognitive labour. Workers became the brains of the machines, pressing buttons and pulling levels. As technology becomes smarter, fewer workers are needed to achieve the same or higher levels of productivity.

&gt; If technology were the ultimate destroyer of jobs, why is US unemployment in 2015 lower than the average of the last 50 years? 

The US has does not hide the fact that the unemployment rate does not represent the actual number of people who are not working.

In the long term, is that a desired outcome though? Your method is often proposed for social security recipients for example, but it's generally supposed that those people will be _dying_ within the next decade or so, and they're handled that way because nobody is very comfortable making granny homeless in the final few years of her life.

But do you really want to pay 25 year old Jamal 20% more money than everyone else for the next 60 years just because he had five kids? Is that a desired outcome?

&gt;That still gives you a large funding pool for UBI without dropping anyone's benefits.

How? The second half of that sentence, yes...you're not dropping anyone's benefits. You're simply rearranging which program is paying some of the money. But how does not reducing those payments result in a large funding pool?

Specifically hanging out $3600/yr to people for every kid they have...I think you're going to run into a lot of opposition to that.

His proposed EITC reform would also require careful consideration. I don't see any specification of where he proposed to put the curve. As is, EITC is basically a cash handout to people with both income and children. The more children you have the more cash you're handed. He wants to give the same handout to everybody regardless of how many children they have, or whether they have children at all...but nevertheless continue to require that they have income to get anything. And the more income they have up to a certain point, the more they get. If you make $20,000, you get handed more money than if you make $10,000.[1] Which is kind of obviously dumb, but to be fair that's not this idea. That's just how EITC works. I'm not sure why he's not proposing to eliminate it altogether. But...either way, keeping it and eliminating the number-of-children qualifier immediately prompts the question: at what level? If you're applying it at say, the 4 children level, and you're giving that now to everybody...that's a _huge_ additional expense. Even at the two children level, he's giving it to everybody...even then it might be a net cost increase because you're now handing out a large tax credit to large numbers of people with no children at all. Looking at an [EITC chart](http://www.irs.gov/publications/p596/ar02.html), I'm guessing he's probably thinking of implementing at the 1 child level. That's probably a net savings, but apparently [over half](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/27/us-usa-families-idUSBRE97Q0TJ20130827) of US households are childless, so I'd want to run the numbers to be sure.

"Both the politics and practicalities of european UBI are super complicated. 

1. Nationalism questions. Citizenship/residency rules. How resistant will people be to qualification issues. At the far-out end, is a single, eu-wide ubi part of the discussion in any way? 
2. Currency.  US is a powerful example because of the dollar. Under some interpretations of economic string theory, this gives them the power to internalize inflationary gains (eg by handing out a UBI) while distributing the costs (inflation) to dollar users (aka everyone).   
The Euro was once considered a potential dollar rival. UBI may prove to be a raison d'etre of ambitions like that. More reason to be the dollar if being the dollar enables a better UBI. 
3. Political culture. Europe generally has more of services culture. The EU has made ""governing by grant"" a little more normal... but there are political norm hurdles to cross. I think Norway is a great example. The oil fund has been an insane boon during the last decade. Equity prices just are so high. But, they've kind of gone with a nordic flavoured trickle down model for spending it. Government spending increases, trickling to salaries contracts, contractor salaries, etc.   
I think there's a weird flavour of inflation going on there. They've stumbled into  some pretty unknown territory through a sort of conservatism. After some world-first levels of thought into creating and structuring the oil fund, they almost avoided thinking about what to do if/when the fund outperformed expectations by so much.   
If Norway had built even a little UBI into the initial model, I think they would have had much better results... with no shortage of funds for public services either. Either start canceling taxes and run the treasury out of oil fund dividends or (more fun and more compatible with nordic values), distribute the dividends and tax your now super-wealthy economy. Even better, use some of this wealth to make sure basic goods (especially housing) inflation doesn't happen.

- Tax incentives for companies to invest in renewables &amp; energy efficiency, and divest in fossil fuels;

- Carbon Tax factoring the full lifecycle assessment costs of all environmental impacts of every product including food.

- 91% tax rate on annual income of more than 3 million dollars with no ability to write down tax obligations ala Trump (plenty of modelling suggests a 3-5% global tax on incomes more than several millions of dollars would cover most of the costs of a Zero-Carbon energy transition).

- Increase in penalties (financial and judicial) for ecological or environmental destruction for all private citizens, Gov and commercial interests.

"I'm UBI-agnostic, slightly leaning towards it.  My fears of it have nothing to do with wealth re-distribution - something that clearly needs to occur in some way.  

Rather, I question whether it is the correct response to the problem.  I worry that it's simply a band-aid rather than a root-cause solution.  

To vastly oversimplify, increasing automation is resulting in both massive wealth inequality and long-term employment loss.  The premise behind UBI is that it will not only provide people with the safety net but also the ability to pursue new job and business creation opportunities without having to worry about losing everything.  The question is whether it will actually do so in the long run.  

We live in a world where the entry level of technical know-how to create a new business keeps climbing.  It's not like someone is going to make a competitive semiconductor fab in their garage or electric car company off UBI wages.  Of course, there will be areas where people can still start up businesses but that slice of the pie will keep getting smaller and smaller as time goes along.  Even traditional manufacturing that was the bread and butter of US homegrown innovation in years past now basically requires CNC machines and other machinery that is so far out of the hands of the regular person that it might as well be sold on the moon.  

Sure, you can talk about 3D printing and other rapid prototyping technologies but they are generally not competitive when you move past the prototype stage and scale up to production at volume.  At best, you can come up with at good idea that has to be produced through the machinery of a much larger corporation if you want to reach a mass market.  That means being stuck in a subsidiary relationship with giants that are going to milk every cent out of your profits they can and use every opportunity to simply take over the market for themselves.

And of course, there will be people who are still able to pull it off.  But my point is that it's going to be an ever shrinking portion of the population who have the knowledge, skill and connections to pull things off.  The average person is going to start finding themselves stranded, doing the equivalent of trying to hock stuff on Etsy or other gig economy crap to get by.

So, if we end up with the scenario where UBI isn't providing the promised (real) job creation, where does it leave us?  Basically, with tens of millions of people who are dependent on UBI to survive and with no real prospects for moving past that point.  That scenario really terrifies me.  

I grew up in Montana, near a lot of native American reservations.  Those are some of the most depressing and hopeless places I have ever seen.

But I don't think it's an entirely broken analogy either.  I'm worried that we'll end up with huge ghettos of people who are getting just enough money to live in economically depressed regions of the country but not enough to move up or to more expensive regions.  They'll be no jobs outside shitty service sector and gig economy work to be found.  Yes, they'll be able to afford food, a shitty apartment and the occasional movie ticket and short budget vacation every few years but is that really a life most people want to live?  Most people need to have aspirational goals to want to get out of bed in the morning.  That might be advancing in a career or providing an essential service to others or pushing the frontiers of knowledge.  If all you have to look forward to is affording food and getting high and playing video games for yet another decade, it is going to eat away at your soul.

And I say this as someone who was pushing for UBI back in the 90s.  Seriously, I saw the trends of automation and AI back then and was talking the ears off people about how we were going to face an apocalyptic scenario where large portions of the population were going to be permanently unemployable and that we needed to rethink our economic systems to deal with that eventuality.

Obviously, I've since soured on the concept of UBI for the reasons above.  I worry that UBI is simply slapping a minimal band-aid on a huge, fundamental problem with economics and our society and will not prevent the increasing formation of insurmountable class structures and inequality.  

What worries me the most though is that in 20+ years of thinking about this problem, UBI is the best solution I have been able to think of.  It's the only reason I'm even vaguely still in support of it.  There might be a better solution out there but it's going to take someone far smarter than I to think of it.",neutral,neutral

What you don't take into account is that the current market system that encompasses and perpetuates your viewpoint is a remenant of the Malthusian Trap, where things like property rights, profit and class division came into existence, as an unfortunate series of side effects as human society struggled to prevent resource demand from exceeding availability and production.

​

neoliberalism is free market capitalism with some level of government intervention in the economy and society. it aims to achieve a high standard of living for people not necessarily through raising minimum wage or giving it free via welfare/UBI, but by making everything as cheap as possible through the free market (as the free market naturally gravitates towards the cheapest/most efficient way to produce goods e.g. chinese factories).

​

whilst government intervention is not looked down on by neoliberals as it is with libertarians, they generally dont want to see it interfere with the free market - they dont like corporate welfare either. nor are neoliberals in support of austerity, they'd rather see some level of privitisation. they dont hate nor like unions, but lets be fucking honest workers in the west have way better rights than any communist fucking country has ever given its workers.

​

increasing the GDP is probably going to increase employment capacity anyway so moving the mandate of the state to raising GDP isnt that bad, and its a shallow view of neoliberalism anyway to state that.

neoliberals also often tend to be fairly progressive by the way - they're similar to the democrats in the US, without the sanders and cortez types.

"Yang addresses fears about inflation in his policy platform, stating that “Our UBI plan has minimal changes in the supply of money because it is funded by a VAT,” and also references the “4 trillion for the bank bailouts” that resulted in “no inflation.” Inflation is about money supply, but a VAT doesn’t do much to the overall supply, it just reallocates things. He doesn’t deny that there would be a price increase by some companies and that the “VAT would also increase prices marginally” but from what I’ve been reading, I really don’t think that the price increases or any sort of infoation that results from Yangs UBI plan would be anything to worry about. I think the benefits would outweigh any negatives related to price increases.

"&gt;However, while with basic income many could leave, it doesn't mean they are all going to leave, especially if they will essentially get an automatic ""raise"", so to speak.

The comment I initially replied to assumed that people would leave the work force, and claimed that would be a good thing. I'm working under that assumption.

&gt;My example was held in an imaginary vacuum.

An imaginary vacuum in which no one can do anything except work for the investor, which is different from how society works in a very important way that I outlined (people that are laid off are freed up to go work on producing other goods and services that people couldn't afford before). So we can't draw any conclusions about the real world from your example.

&gt;Whether he could do more or not is not part of the example, and in the real world, if the this was applied to all companies (people being laid off because of technology) the pattern might resemble my example.

Only to the extent that there are government prohibitions on people trying to fulfill the wants and needs of others. If there are no such prohibitions, then the laid off workers are free to use their skills to make the lives of everyone else better in ways those people couldn't afford to pay for before, but can now because other goods those people buy are being produced more cheaply.

&gt;However they harm economy by doing so.

Actually they're doing the rest of society a great favor, and are doing no harm to the economy.

&gt;Thus, the money gets stuck in their accounts.

OK, and that's great for the rest of society, because fewer dollars in circulation means a drop in the price of goods and therefore the rest of society can afford to buy more goods and services with the fewer dollars that they have. If the rich people instead chose to spend that money on goods and services, the price of goods and services wouldn't go down, and other people wouldn't be able to buy more goods and services.

&gt;As in the example, the now laid off worker's wages are now flowing into the investors account (so to speak; he simply doesn't pay them anymore).

OK, and what's he doing with that money? If it's sitting in his account, that means he's not using it to buy goods and services from the former employees. If the former employees have money, they can use some of it to buy his vital goods and services and the rest to trade among themselves for the new goods and services they're creating in their newly freed up time, like better houses and clothes and food and medical care. Each time they pay the investor for his goods and services, the supply of circulating money decreases, so the amount of dollars they're willing to accept in exchange for their new goods will go down. If the investor refuses to lower his prices to deal with the smaller supply of money, or if the employees simply have no money, and the investor is a silly person and won't trade any of his vital goods for the goods they are now producing, the former employees will have no choice but to make those vital goods on their own and their standard of living will go down. The investor's quality of life will also go down as he won't be able to buy those new goods and services from the former employees. He's stuck with a pile of dollars he can't eat.

&gt;I do not mean to say they should give it for free, but I do think something must be done to reduce that pattern and help resources flow.

People don't need your help trading resources. They need you, and the government, to get out of their way.

&gt;This example was made to illustrate what would happen if all companies did the same thing.

If all companies did the same thing, and the laid-off employees were not prohibited by government from working independently, the standard of living in society would go up. Because people are not totally prohibited from working independently (i.e. starting their own businesses), quality of life has gone up dramatically, even if as you claim wages have stayed the same. The quality of goods that people can buy today is vastly higher. We can buy better food, better clothes, better technology and entertainment, better transportation, better medical care despite all government attempts to make it worse, and so on. We are undeniably far better off than we were 50 years ago, or even 20 years ago.

&gt;In an economy where half the people were laid off, the general population would have half the income, and thus half the capacity to buy goods and services. The investor's would have that other half, but it would not be spent. 

Except the half that got laid off would go work on new things that weren't being worked on before because people couldn't afford to pay for it, but can now because the price of other goods has gone down. So the laid off half would have new income, and society would be much wealthier.

&gt;There is a limit to how much someone can spend, even for rich people.

There doesn't seem to be. They choose to limit what they spend on consumer goods, but there's no limit to what they spend on investment vehicles like stocks and currencies and real properties and so forth.

&gt;No, they don't. They mean the same number of people can generate more goods, not that they can work more. Working more can end up generating more goods, but that is not the only way.

By 'do more work', I mean 'produce more goods'. As in, get more work done.

&gt;Imagine, for example, self-driving trucks.

The number of humans required to keep the same number of trucks delivering products will go down considerably, but there will still need to be humans in the operation, repairing the trucks, finding the raw materials to build and power the trucks, telling the trucks where to go, and so forth. Until there is a fully automated system that would continue to run without any human involvement, the amount of work done is dependent on the number of humans involved. It's not *solely* dependent on that, but it is dependent on that.

&gt;Productivity is becoming independent of human workforce. This is why measures like basic income should be seriously considered.

"I would just stay away from the word ""inflation"" here as it means something very specific and in UBI in general would not lead to inflation  (unless it was paid for by increasing the money supply).

An  increase in demand only would lead to price increases if supply stays constant.

Hah. Funny. I can genuinely avoid any and all biased designations with my point and still be attached to the enemy team somehow.

&gt;If you increase wages and decrease hours worked, who is going to foot the bill for the now higher priced goods?

More time to spend money means more money will be spent. It's why McDonald's unions in Denmark can ensure $21/hr to their employees with the food being barely more expensive. Employees would get a bigger cut of the profit, and they'd be required to work more because they'd sell more. A society where people have money to spend is a society where businesses have consistent high incomes. 

&gt;But wait, because the factory is running 10 hours less, there are now less widgets.

No, now the wealthy widget-making business is just required to hire another employee. That means more people get decent-paying jobs and the business is forced to use more of its profits toward employees rather than trickling it ""down"" to the the wealthiest people.

Besides that, productivity is *never* the problem. I guarantee the problem in most of America is lower demand because so many people no longer have casual spending money. We can't just go and fill the theaters casually all the time, because prices aren't a few dollars. They're $15+ which might save labor costs for the theater not having to fill all those cleaning roles, but it ultimately makes people care less about the culture of going out aside from rare instances. 

The supply side is wringing America dry.

"\&gt; How many people do you seriously think are just trying to milk the system while not doing anything?

I'm not really approaching it from this angle at all.  The system *should* be there to be milked.  The system *belongs to us.*  If it's not serving us, than why is it there?

There is a lot of value that human beings offer that is lost when put in the context of exchanging your time for money.  Your parents (for example) could not provide the same amount of love and support if you had to pay them to be love you.  Those who choose not to work because they're serving their families as *unpaid caregivers* of the elderly, the infirm and the young will *not* be helped by a FJG.  At best, what would a FJG do for us?  Provide government subsidized daycare and old-age retirement homes?  Provide us with work so that we can be paid to look after *other* people's children, *other* people's parents

UBI acknowledges this kind of unpaid value - the kind of value *because it is unpaid*.  Reflect on what the difference between a grassroots movement and an astroturfed movement.  You can enact a FJG to ""build a community"" or you can unconditionally pay everyone 1000 dollars a month and people will voluntarily form their own communities.

\&gt; No one will be forced to work under a jobs guarantee. 

I disagree.  I don't think a FJG would force everyone to work, and I do believe *some* would gladly choose a job from the FJG over whatever they're doing but for many a FJG would introduce a forced-work arrangement.

Consider, that the means testing around many welfare programs means that to qualify one has to be looking for a job.  The implementation of these programs are left to the state governments.  The minute a FJG passes people will be kicked off these programs because a job will suddenly be available to them - whether they actually wanted them or not.  It sounds kind of mean, but many of these state governments are very conservative and will look for any reason to kick people off of welfare and save a little money.

You say ""nobody will be forced to take these jobs"" but without a social safety net (which will effectively be gutted) no one will have a real choice but to take these jobs.

\&gt;Are you saying there are no major problems in the United States right now that could be potentially resolved by training people that sign up to be trained and paying them to fix? Or are you disputing fundamentally that a state run entity can provide any solution to any 'market' or public need? 

Well, federal job training programs generally have a [very low success rate](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/01/the-false-promises-of-worker-retraining/549398/) so I'm already skeptical.

It's not that I don't think state run entities can't be efficient.  Chinese state owned enterprises do very well in fact; however my reading of the GND and the way it's put together leads me to believe that AOC, and Bernie Sanders are not very technologically literate and appear to be taking more input from activists rather than scientists and engineers.  They also seem to have an active disdain for the very types of people who have the most experience running very large organizations that get work done.

I agree that climate change is the most critical issue of our times so I was excited to hear about the GND but the more I read about it the more I found that I actually disagree with it and now I actually don't like it.  The devil's are in the details, of course - but like I said the root cause I believe is that AOC and Sanders are taking more input from activists than engineers and scientists.

\&gt;  a Federal Jobs Guarantee would never exist under another president (as in it would immediately be scrapped) so I'm not sure what saying that addresses here 

This makes the FJG look even worse in my eyes - especially given that means-tested welfare will be effectively defunded as a result of FJG.  Also, are we to expect that the National High Speed Rail project will be planned, approved and constructed in 4 - 8 years?  What's going to happen when the project is in overtime and Bernie's political rivals come into power?

E: lots of people have no concept of just how much disparity there is in wealth in our countries. *Obviously* the current tax revenue needs to be changed to support funding of social programs. Tax havens need to be eradicated, and frankly, the largest burden goes to $1 million+ earners. Want radical? Tax that bracket at 90%. Millionaires simultaneously existing while poverty is rampant is what's wrong with society.

"Actually I still think the best thing to do is community owned robotics. If the local businesses are all cooperatives and the robots we rely on are open source, then the wealth the robots create will be widely shared rather than concentrated. In my mind the biggest problem we have is that private corporations suck up all the profit the workers create. Basic income doesn’t fix that, it just papers it over. If we actually fix the structure of society by moving towards primarily worker owned businesses and we boycott proprietary robotics technology, I believe we would see widespread wealth. I’m a robotics engineer and I’m trying to develop this theory further. Please feel free to ask me any questions about it!

EDIT: Like if your local shops have automated food production and food is so cheap they can almost give it away, then you don’t need as much income. Also “full automation” is more of a myth. We still need people to work alongside robots, typically with increased production.

"Neoliberalism is based on the ideas of the Austrian and UChicago school of economics, especially on the theories of economists like Milton Friedman and Fredrich Hayek. I'm not sure how many actual neoliberals exist in this sub since this sub seems to have become a general American liberalism sub but here are the ideas that neoliberals such as me support:

Free market capitalism

Free trade between all nations of the world

Privatisation of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs)

Economic deregulation

Freedom of movement between different countries

Labour flexibility

American capitalist hegemony

right to work laws and other anti labour union measures 

Post Keynism and post Fordism

Market based urban reforms such as zoning reform

Some neoliberals favour lower taxes across the board, while others like Friedman are supportive of Georgist Land Value taxes.

Citizen entrepreneuralism

Globalisation

Universal basic income

Reduced welfare state

Currently, most (but definitely not all) people in the poverty range income brackets definitely don't have to pay anything out of pocket to go to public college. I work part-time and go to school full time at a local community college and I actually profit a little bit from my financial aid. 

Where it gets tricky is the ""middle-class"" income earners, particularly in places where the cost of living is really high compared to national averages and the state doesn't offer very good financial aid to make up for that. It is because of this that some people will label free college plans like Elizabeth Warren's as a ""gift to the middle class"". Granted, the middle class is shrinking and their income potential hasn't grown in decades so I don't really that that is a good argument, but the outrageous cost of private education still has to be somehow addressed in all this, it shouldn't cost close to a mortgage to go to **any** college.

"&gt; Honestly, even the actual cheats are not the problem. Exchanging a normal life is a working person for this kind of dreary poverty for is hardly a lottery win like, say, being wealth. The people who despise those on social assistance aren't going to be any less contemptuous however thoroughly we're policed. Why should we get the permanent fraud investigation when it's shitty corporations and banks that literally crash the economy every couple years?

I mean, the current economic crash was kind of instigated by our own government, so we'll not count this one. The last major crash was 2008, and it was basically the US reaping what it sowed. We haven't allowed the kinds of games they were playing down there for years here (thanks, 90's Liberals). I'd say 10 years between major economic episodes is a good run--particularly when we didn't exactly have many options this time.

The people who despise us on social assistance fall into two camps. The ""taxes are theft"" camp, who would prefer there to be no universal health care much less no ODSP, and the people who don't know the difference between a disabled person who can't work and an Ontario Works recipient who's doing just enough that their caseworker stays off their back about finding work. It doesn't help that Ontario works is basically a gateway these days for people trying to get on ODSP. As long as ODSP and OW are basically joined at the hip, ODSP will catch hell for OW's existence. But the actual cheats are kind of a problem, because they'd still be cheats if the government decided people on ODSP were worthy of more than $1169/month. They don't do it for the money. They do it because the government owes them something, and screw everything else. These are usually the people who've never worked a day in their life, claimed the CERB anyway, then basically dared ODSP to find out. I mean, they can probably work something out with the CRA if they felt like it, and CRA can't go after their ODSP anyway unless they use the nuclear option and drain their bank account, so at that point their only potential problem will be ODSP finding out. But they don't care about that, because the government owes them.

&gt; What we need is a guaranteed annual income to standardize the depth of grinding poverty and squalor any person can sink into, because it sure doesn't help anyone and there's easily enough wealth in a rich country like Canada to keep everyone housed and fed. It'd help economic circulation a lot better too if more money was being spent on basic human needs and less on high finance gambling.

If we can't get the government to give us a halfway decent rate for ODSP, we're not going to get the government to run out with a basic income. I mean, the NDP already tried that federally with the CERB and that didn't get anywhere. But I'd also argue whatever the government is giving disabled people for high finance gambling is basically chump change at this point. I'm not going to get rich off what the government gives me, even if they let me put it in something that guarantees a return. If you've never worked a day in your life, and no one else is contributing to your RDSP for you, the maximum you'll get from the government is $20000. Good luck doing anything productive with that when you turn 60. You basically have to either be someone or know someone who can contribute to your RDSP in a way that you get both the maximum grant and the maximum bond... and even then, that's only about $90000. I guarantee, you can't get *that* financially creative. Now, factor in you need the disability tax credit to even get the RDSP, very few people actually have a disability tax credit, and even fewer than that actually have an RDSP. The government is probably paying the people at CRA who oversee that program more than they're paying actual disabled people. The only reason I have one in the first place is ODSP ignores its existence. Otherwise I'd have probably opened an RRSP instead. At least that would make a difference on my taxes.",supportive,supportive

"Here's my basic understanding of it. Someone can correct/add to it of they like. There are broadly two types of people:

1. **internally motivated**: This is the minority. They find inspiration and motivation within themselves. They are not very driven by money, prestige, power, etc and other external rewards. They are driven by a sense of internal pride, job satisfaction, quest to learn and explore, etc. These people shine in a socialist environment - poverty, lack of social standing, etc are not real road blocks and their internal drive motivates them to excel with ""common"" resources.

2. **externally motivated**: these are your majority of people. They care about some or all of the external rewards, and will work more and try different things if it means they can get more of the things they care about. (Work longer hours = more money, more visibility, chance at promotions). In a world of basic incomes, free Healthcare, free education, housing, and other social benefits, they are more likely than not to just chill and enjoy the benefits and do the bare minimum to ""meet the quota"" and get by.

Because majority of the people fall under category 2, and not category 1 - overall productivity drops and economy tanks. This is not sustainable unless there is massive automation supporting the economy such that the work of the minority in category 1 can keep the whole majority sustained. 

Even then, the majority in Category 2 start feeling entitled to the benefits while at the same time driven to slave labor for quotas.

"&gt;Also how do u convince the rich to stay rich?

Doing anything to earn money might be a choice, but high-paying jobs and large estates of assets existing is not.

If some of the rich decide to quit their jobs because they feel it's not worth it when they don't get to keep as much money (unlikely, because we aren't talking a very big increase in taxes- most of the money being given out in UBI and Wage-Subsidies would have been money the poor would gave been receiving anyways under a high Minimum Wage and what little remains of the welfare system...  Top salaries go up from having to pay workers less, but tax obligations go up about the same amount...) then someone else (perhaps even someone harder-working from a less privileged background) will just take the job they held.  There are people lining up out the door to work hard and make big money...

If today a company pays 6 US workers $10/hr and 6 Chinese workers for $5/hr, and makes $200/hr in revenue off their labor, $90 of which goes to worker wages, and $100/hr of which goes to executive compensation for one of the company bigwigs, with the remaining $10/hr as stockholder dividends (these numbers aren't even as bad as real life: exec's typically make more than 30 times bottom-tier US workers...)

Under my plan:

The same company would be constrained by no Minimum Wage, so might pay 12 US workers (many of them resettled Latino migrants and refugees) $3.50/hr, and an executive $138 hr, with the remaining $20/hr as stockholder dividends.

However Income Taxes on the executives might go up an additional $67/hr, and Capital Gains taxes on the stockholders the equivalent of an extra $10/hr (Note that Capital Gains went up a bit more proportionally than Income Taxes on executives- because right now we place too much tax burden on high-earners and too little on wealthy Trust Fund babies who do nothing but collect a dividend each month...)

Wage-Subsidies might then provide an extra $3.50/hr on all of those paychecks (1:1 matching for the workers!) including that of the executive, and everyone receive $5k a year in Universal Basic Income (the equivalent of everyone getting an extra $2.50/hr, including the executive).

This leaves a slight ($154/yr per person) shortfall, which might be funded through small increases on Income Taxes on the workers (so the tax-hikes seem more ""fair"" to the executives), on the Middle Class in excess of their UBI and Wage-Subsidies (a couple of those who were ""workers"" in the first scenario might now be Middle Class in the 2nd, their superior socioeconomic status supported by the new migrants and now-larger domestic economy), or my favorite: raising the Gas Tax so we no longer subsidize automobiles so much.

Alternatively (and quite likely given how politicians do business), we might run an extra $2002/year ($154/person) in debt in the latter scenario.  Which seems like a bad idea until you realize that domestic production would go up by $200k/year (half of the $100k/yr being produced before was produced overseas by Chinese workers), domestic pre-tax revenues by $60k/yr (what was being paid to Chinese workers), and tax revenue would increase $154k/yr.  So by any measure, an extra $2k/yr in debt would be manageable: likely the nation's deficit:GDP ratio would improve, and the existing debt become more manageable.

As an astute observer, you might also notice that, after Wage-Subsidies and Universal Basic Income, the US workers were still making $0.50 less an hour than before ($1k/yr).  This is based on the simplifying assumptions that they are all equally skilled (likely, some workers would make less than $3.50/hr, some more), working an equal number of hours (overtime is nice!) and the whole scenario ignores the cost-savings of not having to ship goods from China to the US, which likely saves more than $1k/yr that could be paid to the workers or collected in additional taxes from the shareholders/executives...

Most likely, the native-born workers would either enter the Middle Class or form the more skilled/experienced group of workers (and make more than $4/hr, thus coming out ahead of where they were making $10/hr in the first scenario without an added $6/hr in Wage-Subsidies and Universal Basic Income).  Plus, cost-savings from keeping the factories domestic would provide additional funds to kick around.  And if all this still didn't suffice to keep the native workers at least as well-off as before, there's always deficit-funded increases to the Wage-Subsidies or Universal Basic Income; or assistance programs like college grants, low-interest emergency healthcare loans (to help people avoid medical bankruptcy- if a Single Payer healthcare system weren't also adopted), or refundable child/elder care and home energy-efficiency tax credits to consider... (all of these address major inefficiencies in society: namely that we don't invest enough in education or energy-efficiency, do enough to help people avoid medical bankruptcy, or sufficiently reward child/elder care as the socially valuable activity it is...)

---

All this produces valuable opportunities for socioeconomic advancement for both native workers (the chance to enter the Middle Class, in new positions created by an expanding population of lower-class Latino migrants) and Latino migrants (the chance to settle in a safe country where they can be protected by the rule of law from the violence in their home countries).

It helps us avoid a crisis from the graying of our populace and an expanding dependency-ratio (dependency ratio is the ratio of working-age adults to children and elders past their working years).

And, it brings new experiences, new perspectives, and possibly new geniuses and world-changers (remember, Albert Einstein was a foreign refugee)  to the United States.

It would need to be accompanied by an expansion of the available housing stock, training of more doctors and nurses, and establishment of new colleges and universities to avoid placing extra pressure on these critical goods and services.

Even in a non UBI system you still need this. transaction verification is necessary as well as fraud prevention. 

A perfect example: when I was younger my friends and I would for fun, rent automobiles, purchase the full coverage (normally just profit for the rental car company) and then take those automobiles to the quarry and play demolition derby. when the cars were destroyed we would call the rental firm and say ""Your cars broke down, they are in the quarry""

Now under capitalist society the limitation for this behavior was how much money we were able to devote to this wasteful but fun activity. It had nothing to do with growing up with a capitalist mindset or any anger at the current societal or economic conditions, we simply did it because it was fun. And we would do the same under communism.

Under communism, non UBI system, 25 year old me would go to the state store every week, swipe my card and do this until i got bored of it... unless some system were in place to limit this behavior.

"The basic income proposal is weird enough as is, but the campaign on it is by far one of the worst I've seen, IMHO.

* It suggests getting rid of the existing social safety net, without further explanation. The entire purpose of the current system is to only give money to those who need it; while there is always room for improvement, doing something completely different just for the sake of trying something new is absurd.  
This kind of reasoning, that because the current state is not ideal anything else is necessarily better, is unfortunately pretty common; Donald Trump is its incarnation, just like Berlusconi before (politicians are not doing a great job, therefore let's pick non-politicians).

* It uses the tired old ""luddites"" argument, claiming that this time there really will be job losses that aren't offset by the creation of entirely new job categories. Apparently, nobody has told them that not so long ago, virtually everybody was a farmer (and this is still more or less the case in some developing countries), yet we did just fine when we figured out how to reduce that to &lt;1%.

* The claim that ""the initiative is just a principle"" is ridiculous, it's a transparent cop-out to the obvious question ""How will it be done?"". The Parliament is not all-seeing and all-knowing, it can't magically put into law something that nobody knows how to do. If this passes, the same people currently supporting it will be storming the streets to protest whatever insane tax increases are suggested.

* The proponents don't seem to have even spent one minute thinking about the possible negative consequences: people working less overall which would lower the overall tax revenues (and thus make it harder to collect the money for the basic income itself), various forms of abuse e.g. by families with many kids, the disparity it'd create between Swiss citizens and foreigners, etc.  
Instead they circle-jerk with useless information such as the Mincome trial in Manitoba. Surprise, when you tell people it won't last, nobody quits their job because of basic income!

Just because you agree with the principle, that it'd be nice if we had a basic income or some other means of helping everyone, doesn't mean you should vote for it.

There are plenty of unrealistic things everybody agrees with ""in principle"". End world hunger! Stop the Israel-Palestine conflict! Save Greece! Stop crime!

"I was inclined to agree to a point - I think most people will save for some time. Maybe toward a house, car, or whatever else.

It could be a very long time, sure. I'm not sure what a reasonable sample time is, if you want to study this, or if stipulations are necessary in the first place.

If you put the basic income away for savings/retirement (this in itself is probably good and means you're not the type to default on your obligations, which isn't good for us economically), then you probably already afford a decent living via your actual occupation or otherwise. And chances are, in that case, you're already injecting plenty into the economy.

"There are 3 flavors of UBI (pro welfare, welfare neutral, and anti welfare). Obviously generalizing but the further left will want the pro welfare (stacking with welfare), the moderate parts of both parties will want welfare neutral (opt-in like Yang's plan), and the further right will want anti welfare (replacing all welfare, like almost passed in the 70's with Friedman's negative income tax). If you are mid left or further for sure stacking is generally where you'd lie and supporting something like Sanders JG + min wage is likely where you'd prefer. I wouldn't be shocked if things stay the status quo that in 2024 we'd see someone run on pro welfare UBI. Speaking to elect-ability running on welfare neutral UBI is actually harder in the primaries than it would be in the general election. Yang would need a lot of moderate republicans to vote in the democratic primary, definitely a hard fight.

That's just the politics angle though, there are a couple of milder arguments for welfare neutral, probably doesn't overcome the apprehension but worth considering.

1. Incentives for those on welfare- If you go searching you surprisingly find even already that some that are close to the benefits but over (say $1100, $1200, $1300 a month) would actually prefer to opt-in to the Freedom Dividend. From a math perspective that doesn't make sense but if you look at the reasons they give it centers around eligibility requirements/restrictions, time wasted, and the ability to climb out of poverty. The disability example is a big one especially those partially disabled that could work a little bit but certainly not 40 hours. The incentives of the current programs make it so working lowers their benefit with their case manager as well as can get them declared able bodied (even volunteering can do this in some cases). This really incentivizes them to do nothing and stay doing nothing, forever. On top of that just generally, want to save money to climb out slowly nope sorry. Then there is the case manager, hurdles to climb through, things to attend to get vouchers instead of cash, etc. This is a VERY poisonous mindset to get people into. The ""no strings attached"" part of the FD can flip this to this isn't a handout everyone gets it no conditions.

2. Cost- Unfortunately the welfare overlap portion of the funding for the FD is a huge chunk and this doesn't even include social security which most will also not opt-in. If you include those groups you almost double the cost of the program which is already trillions.",neutral,neutral
"&gt;We'd have to triple tax revenue in order to cover just this one program.

You're missing my point. It's obvious that there MUST be something horribly wrong with your math.

They're not any worse off.

Currently there are X dollars spent on welfare programs, with administrative overhead. Roll it all into basic income instead, and alter the tax structure so that roughly the same people are still getting about X dollars net. Why wouldn't that be possible?

"&gt; But WHY? Why do you believe that?

&gt; What is that person bringing to the table? Keep in mind we are bartering here.

You *really* lose me—and I assume people who think like me—with this point here. Whose table are we talking about here? 

Because 'that person' brings a lot of things to a lot of different tables. 
Take this hypothetical, say there is a UBI in the US of $30,000 and someone does not work but pays taxes—income tax, state/local, sales (if applicable)—well, that person is helping perpetuate the sovereign currency of the State, providing value to US dollar by paying taxes in it, purchasing goods/services within the economy, etc. Is your claim that person brings nothing to 'the table'?

If so, you are talking about a more specific table. I think you get at it here—

&gt; **The market** is offering one Resource (Money = Self-Sufficiency). That person has to bring something to the other side of the table as well. As of right now, they are bringing 40 hours of UNSKILLED Labor.

So what if I disagree with how 'the market' is structured. There are myriad criticisms of 'free' markets, I won't go into them here. 

Your broad claim, as I understand it is that for someone to *earn* a living wage, they ought to contribute something (of equal value?) to the 'system'. You don't really explain what the 'system' is that this person needs to contribute to in order to deserve a living wage. 

&gt; I personally think that some jobs exist so that you WANT &amp; NEED to get the hell out of them.

This is a pretty heterodox view of the labor market, but that aside, your entire point here seems to be geared around the value that the person provides to the 'free' market, not the state. Well, people are not citizens of markets, they are citizens of states and the value they create for that state is often unquantifiable in easy-to-comprehend market terminology—ie. military conscription, taxes (as a I mentioned before)—so why is it that you are placing these market based values above values to the State?

Not to mention, the mere existence of the jobs you describe above *necessarily* perpetuate inequality in society on immutable bases—mentally or physically handicapped people, people of color (in certain communities), sex/gender, etc.—so do you believe these people, born in a condition that does not allow them to achieve the desire to 'WANT &amp; NEED' to move past certain types of employment should be penalized by the happenstance of their birth?

"Before I begin, I just want to remind you of something. Conservatives, for years, have been advocating for making recipients of welfare at least look for work. Under the Obama administration, those requirements were all but removed. Just wanted to get that out there. 

Anyways, I appreciate you not calling me evil because I’m conservative. I’ve gotten quite tired of hearing it, and it’s nice to have a change of pace, so thank you. We have a broken welfare system, I think we can all agree on that. The system encourages people to leech off of it. It shouldn’t do that. Andrew Yang’s UBI was a good idea, if it were modified slightly where you had to be seeking employment or employed to receive the benefit, with no other strings attached. 


There are things I believe we should legislate. Firing someone because they are ill, thus cutting off their health insurance, should be illegal if it isn’t already. I recently had a family friend pass away. She had been in the hospital since September 17. She was in for 3 months and some change. Her employer never fired her. She obviously did not get paid, but she always had insurance. That should be a legal requirement for every company. We also need to lower costs of medication and doctor visits. Doing things like raising the minimum wage will not work in the long run, but setting some sort of, not price cap, but profit cap(I’ve never heard of an idea like this before, maybe I’m mistaken, but where you can only earn a certain amount of profit from a sale. Obviously would change depending on product) on medication. 

Make hospitals accept Medicare. It’s that simple. As long as Medicare doesn’t force hospitals to operate at a loss, make them take it. That would work in conjunction with profit caps. 


If we limit the prices of drugs, and force hospitals to accept Medicare as long as it doesn’t make them operate at a negative, private insurance and drug companies will have to become competitive. 

I do just want to comment on forced car insurance. That is one of the most stupid things I’ve ever heard of in my life. Let’s make it illegal for people to be poor, great idea.

UBI will pay for itself not with the cost UBI brings, but with the social foundations it provides, and economic growth it will create. youre looking at this as a money=money valuation, which is always going to show ubi as 'too costly to implement'.

there are 2 UBI arguments usually.

once UBI gets rolling, and people start actually spending money again, more taxes are collected. more goods are purcased. more jobs are needed. more taxes are collected. the cycle continues.

A conservative study of a $1000 a month UBI calculated a 12+% growth in the economy in 8 years along with 2 million + new jobs due to the UBI alone(see the Roosevelt institute study). The fact is that when you offer money to people who currently are struggling to get by, they spend it. A dividend of $12000 a year would massively increase the consumer base of the US economy. Demand within the American economy would massively increase across the board. New businesses would open and new employment opportunities would naturally rise at higher numbers as the economic boot is taken off peoples throats. The fact is that millions of workers in the retail, trucking, accounting, medical, and administrative industries are going to lose their jobs to automation and artificial intelligence. What will these people do? Retraining programs have had success rates of under 15%. You said the government shouldn’t give people money for doing nothing, but what will these millions of people and their millions of families do when they lose a job they have invested their entire lives into to a robot?

"Universal Basic Income

My political views are pretty ""left."" Minimum wage, universal health care, etc. This all comes from the principles that:

- a person should be paid a living wage for honest work, and that honest work is ANY work not just tech or medicine or owning a business

- that people, generally, do want to work for a living

- that policy should err on the side of compassion not cruelty

- we don't have a plan on how to deal with automation and globalization killing jobs

So when I first came across UBI I figured, sure, that sounds radical but maybe it's necessary. Now Finland's trying it and they seem to be happy and prosperous.

Then Mark Zuckerburg and some Silicon Valley types started talking about and I get worried. That culture is generally hardcore libertarian and economically right-wing so why would they be into it?

Then I realized- maybe they just want the government to make sure there is just barely enough money in the hands of the public to buy their products. We still need consumers, but how can you have consumers without labor? UBI.

Can you explain why UBI and capitalism are not compatible?,against,"As an AI language model, I don't have opinions, but I can provide information. Some people argue that UBI and capitalism are not compatible because UBI challenges the fundamental principles of capitalism, such as the idea that individuals must work to earn income and that income is distributed according to market forces. UBI, on the other hand, provides a guaranteed income to individuals regardless of whether or not they work, which some argue could disincentivize work and lead to a breakdown in the capitalist system. Additionally, funding UBI would require significant redistribution of wealth, which goes against the capitalist principle of allowing individuals to keep the fruits of their labor. However, others argue that UBI could actually strengthen capitalism by providing a safety net that ensures individuals have the means to participate in the market economy and take risks, such as starting a new business or pursuing education or training that could lead to better job opportunities."

"Of course people are going to do better when they are given more money, that was never the question. All of the studies answer that question, which we already know. The real questions are

- Does UBI cause inflation, eliminating most of the gains of UBI
- How are we going to pay for it?
- If part of paying for it involves eliminating social programs, are people better off with UBI (where they can choose what to do with their money) compared to other programs where they can't? What do we do if someone spends all their UBI on addiction, do we just let them be homeless?
- Do people stop working when on UBI, resulting in declining tax revenues that make it impossible to fund? 25% of the study left their job, despite knowing that the UBI they were getting was only temporary - how many people will leave their job when they know they will be getting UBI for their whole life?

Those are the questions we need to answer in order to move forwards with UBI, and I haven't heard a satisfactory answer for any of them yet.

And the basic income suggested in the article isn't even the same UBI that most people are suggesting, instead it just brings people up to the calculated living income of the area that they are in. That is probably one of the worst ideas I have heard. It completely eliminates any motivation for someone to increase their income if they are below the calculated living income, since any increase is wiped out by a decrease in support. And it will lead to runaway housing prices, since now everyone is guaranteed to be able to live anywhere in the country, since the government will adjust payments to cost of living, so now everyone can move to downtown Toronto, causing apartment rents to skyrocket because the government will just keep raising the assistance to match the rising prices due to demand.",neutral,neutral

Now, while you targeted your question to libertarians and not anarchists, I should remind you you're on an anarcho-capitalist subreddit. In the case of non-anarchist libertarians, they do often support social safety nets. Typically they'll be in a different form than you're used to that simplifies the welfare state though, such as through a negative income tax or through a universal basic income funded by a land value tax(in the case of geolibertarians). So, both your assumptions that this is a sub for non-anarchist libertarians and that libertarians oppose social safety nets are just plain false.


Edit:

Next time if you want to come off as not arguing, don't ask a loaded question - a question with (a) presumption(s) built into it.

What I like about that is that in our current system as you gain potential to earn, you lose welfare entitlement. Say you make $500/mo from work and $800 from welfare. Then you get a raise to $1k/mo but then you disqualify yourself from receiving as much welfare. It kind of incentives you away from progression. I like that UBI takes a huge portion of attempted incentivisation and administration away.

Also his closing the loopholes likely goes back to an implementation of the VAT, a tax. The US is the only modern economy without a VAT. The VAT is a mostly an un-gameable program that avoids the crazy tax codes that inadvertently create loopholes in our current tax system.",supportive,supportive

"This is a really great post and I’m glad that you made it. I have a few questions if that’s cool with you?

You started off by saying that the kids who could have become engineers but didn’t: they are missing out on seeing their full potential.

Wouldn’t you also agree that it takes an individual to apply themselves in work hard at doing whatever it is they do to maximize the potential that they’re born with? For instance you can see a guy like Morgan Freeman who was born completely poor, black in an era where civil rights didn’t exist, and yet he is one of the most successful actors of all time. Economically speaking, he worked hard and maximize the potential he had at every point in his life, and he is one of those people who say you should just pull yourself up by your bootstraps. I would not suggest that that is the case for everyone, but I also think it would be extremely unfair to tax everyone for the sake of those who don’t apply themselves or even attempt to make an effort. 

Taxing those who have applied to them selves, who have applied the resources, who are creating jobs for others in who are us building wealth not just in themselves but also in their businesses, I just think is wrong on the basis that you want to only help those who are not in those positions.

Taxing billionaires just discourages millionaires from claiming the billions that they could make, I just don’t see how it makes a whole Lotta sense. Now granted I am not nearly as financially literate as you are, so what I’m hoping is that you can read this comment see where I’m coming from but then help me realize where I might be wrong?

I’m really stuck on the part where you said kids all could just grow up and become engineers if given the chance: Every single child in America has that chance right now, even though they may have different levels of adversity to deal with; relatively speaking, everyone has some level of adversarial issue in their life that bars them from doing certain things, and others turn that into the fuel they need to propel themselves into a career that is rewarding. 

If we were to simply make every educational program in the country or even in the world free of charge to those who want to apply, that still does not solve the issue of those who will not apply themselves, but will take up those resources because they are being handed out. If you were to look at the welfare state in Georgia, for instance, laws were passed to Force anyone who applied for welfare/EBT cards would be asked to work a certain number of hours a week to be eligible, and had to do so through a number of listed organizations that worked with the state. What ended up happening was that the people who had applied, realize that they were working hours that they would be paid more for if they just found a regular job. And the numbers of people that were on those programs dropped significantly.

What I missing maybe, in your comment, is the rationale for why people would not abuse this or any other increase in programming that just hands out cash Under the assumption that people can’t simply work for themselves? We didn’t introduce a UBI when we got rid of the horse and carriage, even though cars were invented, do you see what I’m saying?

"&gt;It's pretty simple. A couple hundred years ago, it took about three quarters of the population to grow enough food for everyone. Now it takes about three percent, even with our horrible inefficient subsidized agricultural system. There's 14 unoccupied homes for every homeless person in the country. The resources exist to provide for every single person, but we distribute them in such a way that they can't get access to them.

Oh sure, in the immediate term there's resources on-hand, but in terms of technology whereby the amount of food, clothing, and shelter people need or want is communicated to those who produce those goods. I assume you have something in mind other than simply allowing people to set prices and exchange voluntarily.

&gt;If you need a doctor, you don't have any choice but to participate in our screwed up medical system, and if you need money, you don't have any choice but to participate in our screwed up employment system. That means that certain things are a given no matter what the individuals involved are like.

That doesn't really clarify things for me. I understand that we need medical care at times, but isn't demanding that someone provide me that care whether they want to or not and whether I will adequately compensate them or not, a bad thing?

&gt;It's a product of the system. If you're doing anything wrong, it's not participating in the system as it exists, but rather helping to maintain that system, and honestly I don't think you're even really guilty of that.

I definitely agree the system is imperfect.

For the most part, yes. I think many more people would participate in non-productive activities or activities of very subjective worth like art and sports. I don't see anything wrong with that in and of itself. I just think that calls into question what few, even, would want to take it on themselves to keep the great mass of society comfortable. Not out of loathing for others, but simply because they could enjoy the same themselves.

&gt;It's just a matter of how they're distributed.

Yes, but that is an important matter. ;) In-fact it's so difficult to do all states to date have failed miserably at it.

&gt;Define ""leisure."" I mean, I can't speak for you, but I know I wouldn't be happy with just existing. I need to create things. And besides that, I'd like some luxuries so my leisure time is more enjoyable. Would I be working 40 hours a week? Hell no, but that's not required to keep society functional.

I'd be content to hike, hunt, fish, tend my garden, and generally enjoy my front porch.

&gt;Obviously food, clean water, and shelter. I would also argue that access to information and healthcare would count. Electronics are so cheap now that information is easy. All that stuff can be covered by a basic income, but health care is a little more complicated. There's really only two routes you can take with healthcare. You either make it completely universal and treat everyone, or you refuse to treat people who don't have insurance and can't pay. Personally, I lean towards the former option, but I can understand that there are advantages to the latter option as well.

Have you tried making a spreadsheet estimate for how much that might cost per-person in relative dollar figures?

&gt;Then tough shit. There has to be at least some motivation to work. We haven't quite reached the level of pushing a button and having anything you want yet.

So there is an enforcement mechanism as a back-stop in case too many people decide they'll just be on the take?

&gt;I'm certainly in favor of cheap, government constructed housing for people who don't need a whole lot of space. If someone else offers a better deal, I'm not gonna stop anyone from taking it. And if you want something better, you'll need to do at least a little work for it.

As someone who has supplied government contractors building said housing, it's not really cheap to construct. The lack of competition means prices are actually very high and the quality is extremely low. You would essentially be constructing a great mass of slums.

&gt;Well, I live in a small two bedroom apartment that's worth about 90,000 dollars, so I figure somewhere in the neighborhood of 100k in current dollars. I want to make it possible for everyone to own their own home without having to pay taxes on it. 

More generous than I thought, but if much of the resources are being diverted to these government housing projects, how will people be able to get the resources for private homes? I assume the state will get first-dibs on building materials.

&gt;Right, but that actually makes the problem worse. If success was completely random, it would still be a statistical certainty that some people would come out way ahead. But in fact some people have abilities that make them way more likely to succeed than others, which tilts things even more in that direction. Whether or not they ""deserve it,"" the fact that they'll get it is inarguable. 

How do you control for this? Kill the higher IQ children? Purposefully handicap them? Lavish twice the resources on more reluctant learners?

&gt;Well, fractional reserve banking definitely doesn't help matters. But it's really inherent to capitalism. Consider: Who will have an easier time starting a new business? Someone starting out with nothing, or someone who already owns a successful business and has large amounts of resources, experience, and contacts available?

Actually, fractional reserve systems are mercantile. But as for who is more likely to start a business: the person with an idea that can succeed as a business. I started from pretty much nothing. My wife and I had ~$2000 saved up and I got a loan from the local bank to match it, but we're still successful considering our idea worked out and people liked what we had to offer.

&gt;Are they? They are entirely reliant on money and media coverage to keep their seats. That means they're beholden to the people who have money. Look at what happened to Ron Paul, or any candidate the big corporations don't like.

Yes, I would say they are. Politicians have people killed, like Michael Hastings, MLK, JFK, etc. etc. Ron Paul was in office a very long time. I don't think that his career was in any way ruined by corporations, though he was of-course maligned by the politically-deferential media.

&gt;If they want someone to do something for them, they have to pay for it just like everyone else. They do have other means of getting people to do what they want them to do via the government, of course, but as I said before, that ability is heavily dependent on other people paying them.

Power of the purse resides with the congress (and the federal reserve). ;)

&gt;Because they don't want to fail, and with enough wealth at their command, they have the ability to suppress competition so that they don't fail.

Sorry that's just not true. Massive companies do go out of business or get sold off int bits and pieces. It's only when states step in and nationalize or subsidize that they have the ability to becoming immortal and suppress any chance at competition.

&gt;Well, capitalism doesn't exactly have a monopoly on corruption. But countering it requires putting strict safeguards on the people who have power, as well as distributing and diluting that power as much as possible. Those things are impossible in capitalism.

I would argue those things are not just possible, but always the case in a free market without a state. First, there is no arbitrary monopoly on any power. Second, the distribution and dilution of that power is in the interest of everyone in the marketplace.

&gt;There are a couple of measures you can take to prevent that. For starters, don't allow a deficit.

Oh I like that, but I don't think that will mix well with building tons of public housing and providing everyone 100k in spending money.

&gt;That means that any increase in social programs results in an increase in taxes, which isn't gonna be popular. And any decrease in taxes will result in a decrease in social programs, which also isn't gonna be popular. Is it perfect? No, but no system is.

If there are to be social programs in a free society that is how they should be funded. (So long as anyone can opt out)

"I recommend reading the article.  It's written from a social democratic standpoint and it brings up many salient points.  A UBI that isn't high enough to allow workers to turn down precarious labour will make the precarious labour situation significantly worse.  As long as people are dependant on lousy jobs, UBI will become little more than a subsidy for employers to justify lowering wages, as well as a subsidy for landlords.   They propose a benefit to top up those that fall below the poverty line would be significantly more impactful and cost a lot less.  There's also the issue of conservatives using UBI as a justification to gut other aspects of our social safety net.  $2000 a month without EI and Medicare and were significantly worse off than we are right now.  No doubt about it that we need a more robust system of social security and it's worth investing in, but UBI is not the cure all many think it is.

What will NOT stack is the means-tested programs. They will remain existent of course. Yang has no intention to remove them, but people who do not want to make the switch because they receive over $1k/mo in benefits will be able to stay with those programs.

As a side, there is good reason people will prefer UBI of $1k/mo over other welfare programs because of the nightmare that it can be. Just read this post made on the yang sub:  [**Anyone who says that replacing welfare programs with UBI is a bad thing has clearly never been on a welfare program.**](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/YangForPresidentHQ/comments/d107u3/anyone_who_says_that_replacing_welfare_programs/)

The only programs that are opt-in with the freedom dividend are the programs that were created with the paternalistic racism, that Democrats like Joe Biden Believe in, these programs assert that the poor have made a mistake by being poor and should be punished.

This article by campaign associate and UBI activist Scott Santens should assuage those concerns. I too was initially concerned with this issue but then I read this article and it changed my entire perspective.

It's hard to grasp, but computers are becoming smart. When you write a program you don't need to rewrite it from scratch but can build on what already exists. Google, IBM and many others are teaching machines how to learn. Robots don't complain or slack off. They can run 24/7, 365 days a year. If you create a software program you can multiply it 7 billion times for an insignificant cost. 


Most jobs that can be broken down into a large number of small steps will be automated, it's just a matter of when. I'm not saying all jobs will be automated or that new jobs won't be created, but in the next 50 years there will be more jobs automated than created, causing an increase in the unemployment rate. Politicians do not debate the effects of an increase in automation but Futurists do.

"Money is currently created (in the U.S.) by both the Treasury Department when it prints paper currency and coins, and by banks that are allowed by the government to loan multiples (the reserve ratio) of their actual deposits. This creates multiple points of failure: if the Treasury prints too much or too little money, if the reserve ratio is set too high or too low, or if lending practices are not optimal, the economy will experience a boom or a bust, often leading to changes in the amount of money printed, and/or the reserve ratio, and/or lending practices that will push the economy in the opposite direction, where the cycle repeats.

Instead, the Treasury should be the sole creator of money, and it should distribute it evenly via a universal basic income. That reduces the system to one point of failure, easily corrected.

You kind of already explained this (from a leftist POV) in your first paragraph when you mentioned personal autonomy and freedom of choice.

Something like UBI is maybe a little bit more controversial as of right now but basically any policy that attempts to redistribute wealth is grounded in the assumption that, even when basic political rights are guaranteed, people can still be greatly limited in their ability to act, and therefore to fully be free, by a lack of access to resources. 

Maybe these are expansions of rights that you don’t believe to be important, or maybe you think the potential costs will outweigh the benefits. Those are valid positions.

How is the drug user on the corner of the street going to start a new business. Where does the capital come from? Not the UBI has that isn't enough to live on.  Who is going to buy from them?

The ""just run a business"" line has been pitched by neoliberals for 30 years, yet unemployment exists. Almost like it doesn't work. 

""UBI provides up the poverty line which is defined as enough to get all the essentials""

It doesn't does it - otherwise it would be the living wage. There is no way the proposed UBI is enough to live on long term. You run out of clothes, cars, housing. Just like with Unemployment Benefit. 

The Alaskan dividend isn't enough to live on. Neither is UK Child Benefit or Universal Credit. Or even the State pension. 

And if it is enough to live on then people will do just that - back to my pensioner example of people on the golf course. 

Why should others prop them up with taxes if they are not adding anything to the pot. They won't. They'll vote to have it stopped or reduced to an inadequate amount - as they have in every single case so far. 

You are contradicting yourself at every turn here. 

""UBI is a domestic program and not meant to solve global exploitation of international labor.""

You agree then that the real goods to fund your utopia come from people you are exploiting via a fixed exchange rate mechanism. In other words a slave class somewhere else that provides the imports to balance the books.

How do you feel about living off exploited labour elsewhere in the world that you can quietly and conveniently ignore by drawing an arbitrary boundary around your world?  

""Studies on UBI show that it doesn't lead to a decrease in employment.""

There has been no studies on a UBI covering an entire currency area. The ""studies"" are always in a small area linked to others with a fixed exchange rate - which is where the goods to prop up the utopia come from and where the unemployment therefore gets moved to. Another illusion.

And every single one of those schemes have ended. Stopped by pressure from the areas not getting the freebies. 

The studies all show that UBI doesn't work. Every single one of them.

"&gt; we can get UBI and regulate companies so that they don't abuse our data. It's not an either-or.

I probably didn't clarify my point well enough. Yang understands the tech industry better than any other candidate. [He put forth specific goals in regulating the industry](https://www.yang2020.com/blog/regulating-technology-firms-in-the-21st-century/), his 4 points being (emphasis mine): 

* **Regulate the use of data and privacy by establishing data as a property right.** The associated rights will **enable individuals to retain ownership and share in the economic value generated by their data.**
* Minimize health impacts of modern tech on our people, particularly our children. I will create a Department of the Attention Economy that focuses on smartphones, social media, gaming, and apps, and how to responsibly design and use them, including age restrictions and guidelines.
* Stop the spread of misinformation that is eroding trust in our institutions and fanning the flames of polarization in our society. I will scale up VAT on digital ads to hasten a shift away from ad-driven business models, **require disclosures on all ads, regulate bot activity, and regulate algorithms, addressing the grey area between publishers and platforms.**
* Adopt a 21st century approach to regulation that increases the knowledge and capacity of government while using new metrics to determine competitiveness and quickly **identifies emerging tech in need of regulation.** 

One of the primary ways Yang proposed to pay for UBI was by implementing a value-added tax (VAT) that could scale with different market sectors. [He was primarily targeting Silicon Valley and Tech.](https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/andrew-yang-tax?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2) Again, the premise being that tech companies are clearly benefitting the most from our data and yet finding loopholes to not pay their share. So he wanted to go after them, take their money, and re-distribute it back to us. 

And what is crazy about all that, is [he got a lot of support from tech companies that agreed this is the right thing to do.](https://www.space.com/elon-musk-endorses-andrew-yang-president.html) I'm actually a California data scientist/engineer that works in this exact tech space (AR/VR, machine learning, biometrics, etc) and from my personal experience I found lots of others in this sector that supported Yang as well because we all recognize that our economic livelihood depends on data mining, but we aren't all pieces of shit that don't care about the people contributing such data.

"The post that's linked is meant to show that the Freedom Dividend will help the majority of people who need welfare. Very likely a single mother with 3 kids will be helped by the Freedom Dividend. Plus, when those kids turn 18 they will begin receiving the FD, which will greatly help them start their own lives. Also keep in mind there are other policy proposals, like the [Prosperity Grants](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/prosperity-grants/), and just a likely increase in charitable donations from the increase in disposable income.

If someone is fortunate enough (at least relative to the majority of applicants) to be receiving more than $1000/month in welfare benefits, they can keep their current benefits and forego the FD. If they get a job/raise or otherwise disqualify themselves from their benefits, they will have the FD waiting for them.

UBI also acts as an economic stimulus, so for those receiving welfare because they can't find a job (especially in areas of the country that are in a bad economic state), job opportunities have the potential to increase.

So, yes, I'm sure there are examples of people who won't benefit from the FD in its initial incarnation. But the vast majority will, it gives a foundation for all, and it's a starting point to work forwards from. I think the long-term goal should not be to stack the FD with existing benefits, it should be to evolve the FD to a point where means-tested welfare programs are no longer needed.

So, not my table, really.

Of course, per-capita-GDP-linked Basic Income could replace that system as well, because demographic variance isn't going to have as much of an effect on total cost of benefits, and a lower employment-population ratio will simply mean lower (but barring dramatic contraction, still-adequate) income supports during one's working life, which will be balanced by support over a longer period of retirement.

The flag that's on the moon is an American Flag, put there by American ingenuity and dedication.  Our unbelievable ability to achieve our goals has netted us a very large economy, and that economy has leaked into some places it really shouldn't have (politics, namely) and as such we've gotten off-track by a pretty far way.  But the thing is that our potential remains.  I firmly believe that we can be number one again, and I sincerely hope that we will be.  The global economy is going to face some monumental changes as automation severely reduces the number of workers we need, and we're going to need to severely rethink the way we deal with unemployment and underemployment, and it might require actual honest-to-god socialism (probably not communism though, and there is a difference).  We may actually be moving towards the economic system shown in Star Trek, in which basic needs like shelter and sustenance are provided by the state and one's career exists for personal development and self-actualization (or a noble cause) rather than income.

There are some interesting ideas, I know that there have been some fairly successful implementations of negative income tax, basic income, etc. in some places (check out the [Mincome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincome) project), but we'll need to make those actually work to get through this.",neutral,neutral

Now there's a lot of philosophical questions in there. Who gets to judge levels of happiness and fulfilment, for one, and what actions are allowed to pursue it, but the idea stands.




Humans need purpose, they need community, they need a connection to nature, they need family, they need social esteem. People have a lot more freedom now, but they also have way fewer links to the world around them. Locked inside with radio, then television, then games, then the internet, and now social media and whatever the fuck TikTok is, we're growing more isolated and anxious.

For many people, leaving the house to go to work is their *only* sense of community. Even relatively well adjusted people find themselves locked in a cycle of work-exercise-eat-masturbate-sleep, desperately looking for a partner on dating apps to share their suffering.








Now I'm being *sliiiiightly* hysterical for effect here, but I do think we need to address this. We encourage people to eat healthy, we encourage people to exercise, but we also need to encourage people to form communities and reach out to the people around them. Permanent unemployment will leave a lot of people *not* achieving their goals and self-actualising, but instead consuming media 24/7 and sliding into the sort of situational depression that used to be reserved for neckbeards.",neutral,neutral

He doesn't anymore. The Pandemic made life more difficult for his friends that own businesses in the restaurant/bar industry, which he concludes means that people are lazy and won't work if you give them money. 

&gt;Medicare for All, expanding the social safety net, LGBT, relaxed drug laws, abortion

And yet he moved to Texas. How is he supporting those things when he moves to a state that opposes all those things? See this is an easy example of how easy it is to talk, much hard to actually back up that talk with real action.

* [Here is GHWB and Reagan responding to an immigration question in 1980](https://old.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/uuspay/i_found_this_video_interesting_now_that_greg/)

Just conveniently ignore how much this rhetoric would align with the Democrat party of today. Ignore how Reagan, GHWB, GWB would be run out of the party for being too liberal. Ignore how McCain and Romney, both who won the Republican primary for President in 2008 and 2012, are despised by the party now.

They are in dormitories with proper beds, albeit in close proximity, they have functioning toilets (although dirty, but hey, they probably clean these themselves) without risk of diseases spread through poor sanitation. Their income, although very low, is still sufficient for them to go out on the weekends to enjoy with their buddies and still have enough leftover to remit back home.

You may find plenty of stories online of workers being mistreated by companies, but those are individual companies and do not represent the industry as a whole.

1~     Yang runs with libertarians who want to destroy the social safety net.   His original UBI plan was written for that goal but then adjusted when he started getting bad press for it.  Read these articles, the first of which was written before the adjustment, and the second of which was written afterward.   It's chilling.

I had a Yang supporter tell me that I was being too harsh in judging Yang on a predatory policy that he abandoned ""many months ago.""  But if a politician just MONTHS ago is writing policies that cut benefits for the poor and target Social Security for elimination, we should pay attention to what they are telling us about themselves.    
.       

2~    Yang will not end the forever wars and regime change wars.  His policy website makes it clear that ending the wars is not a priority for Yang, and not even really on his agenda.  Despite some tepid words in other settings suggesting that there should be less war, the  ""Yang Doctrine"" establishes as just reasons for war exactly the arguments that are currently being used to defend the warmongering.   Under Yang, the wars would continue.    
.    

3~    Yang is an authoritarian who would expand the Patriot Act security state.   Yang's website doesn't even mention the Patriot Act!   He apparently is fine with the infrastructure of authoritarianism ushered in after 9/11.  Not just fine....He has indicated that he wants to EXPAND the crimes for which terrorism charges can be brought, thus increasing the pool of Americans who can become subject to this terrifying, unaccountable ""justice system"" in which due process is merely optional.   While Bernie understands the grave danger of our corporate-consolidated media that does the bidding of corrupted government, Yang expresses concern about ""fragmented media.""  He would INCREASE government control of what we see and hear, and he wants to police ""fake news.""   Yang also describes the beginning of what sounds a bit like the Chinese social credit system.  He wants government apps to track citizen behavior, such as volunteer work, so that the government can reward ""good citizens"" (my italics) with things like access to public officials.  This is creepy stuff; we have seen in China how goverment tracking of citizen behavior and social credit systems can and will be abused.  Notice that Yang's expressed concerns about surveillance are carefully limited to talk about corporations who take your data and sell it.  He does not touch the massive, unconstitutional government surveillance state that Edward Snowden revealed.     

.        


In short, Yang consistently is a danger on the policies that are most important to the oligarchy.   AND he is the candidate best positioned to help them achieve their Holy Grail:  ending Social Security and the social safety net.        
.      
  

People don't understand much about Yang's agenda, and that is by design.  His website throws out over 150 policies, both minor and major, and makes people sift through them all in order to figure out what the hell he really believes.  It takes a great deal of effort to go through it all and notice what is in there and what isn't, and what his overarching goal for government really is.  Most people know he is for UBI, but they have no idea what type of UBI, and they don't realize his establishment positions on war, the authoritarian state, and healthcare.  Like other establishment candidates, Yang lies about supporting Medicare for All but actually supports a much more conservative plan.     
.       

The corporate media and the online propaganda machine have been working consistently to give the vague impression that Yang is sort of like Bernie and Tulsi--lumping him in with them whenever they talk about ""anti-establishment candidates.""  But policy is what reveals Yang.   His actual policies aren't remotely similar to theirs.  In every major area, his policies are more in line with the goals of the corrupt oligarchy that runs this nation right now.   The huge areas I listed above are the key ones that reveal him, although he also is corporate on a host of other policies ranging from education to borders.     
.    

Yang has been flying under the radar, but he is the oligarchy's last stealth candidate, and possibly the most dangerous one.
