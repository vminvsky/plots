"Hi Andrew,

My skepticism about UBI is that it'll have a ripple effect that increases prices and cost-of-living in proportion, since every American is slightly richer. (You could say the same about raising minimum wage, but since that hasn't changed for decades, raising it to where it ought to be may not be so drastic). What aspects of the plan keep this from happening?

Also, what of Americans for whom an extra $12k a year won't be enough to escape bad living conditions?",neutral,neutral

"Inflation occurs when prices rise due to increases in production costs, like raw materials and wages. A surge in demand for products and services can cause inflation as consumers are willing to pay more for the product. Inflation can also occur when money is printed and injected into the economy. UBI can be paid for with a 10% VAT which is a tax at every stage of production, when VATs were introduced in Europe they found that only half of it was passed onto the consumer. So you will see an increase on certain products (5% to 10%). If you were recieving an additional $1000 per month tax free though you would need to spend $12000 per month on consumable products to cancel it out, which is highly unlikely unless you’re fairly well off. 

Another thing to note about VAT’s is that you can tailor them to certain products. For example you can exclude items that poor people usually buy and increase them on luxury items that rich people usually buy.",neutral,neutral

That being said, UBI would be a much better way of administering a welfare state if it replaced programs like Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid.

&gt;The safeguards for social programs are there because we want to ensure that people that need the money are getting it. I disagree with this idea of painting those safeguards as ""assuming people are evil"".

'Safeguards' exist to stop a bad thing happening. They do not exist to enable a good thing. In this connection they stop the unworthy from getting the money. Unworthy comes in many forms, but at the end of the day it almost always boils down to, ""people are cheating cheaters who will cheat if I let them."" 

There are a constellation of cognitive biases related to the fundamental attribution error that make all of us assume ""other people are less good than I am."" This is not a moral position I'm talking about. It is an set of unconscious biases and cognitive processes that make us snap to negative judgment of others. This, I think, leads quite directly to moral ideas about people being evil at our core, and having to put safeguards in place to protect against that evil. This is not an insane position to take by any means: some people are bad some of the time. We _do_ need some safeguards, like audits, police, and the rule of law. We don't need expensive bureaucratic nightmares that deny people access to resources they need.

"&gt;Can someone explain how this idea would be beneficial in the western world specifically?

If you had to give out UBI worldwide, the amount would be so low as to vanish practically into negligibility for people living in advanced western countries.

In general, though, the benefits of UBI include reduced crime, reduced health problems (physical and mental alike), reduced waste (both on bureaucracy and on supporting/performing useless jobs), improved education (because people can actually afford to take time off for their education), *vastly* improved flexibility of working conditions (employment becomes no longer an all-or-nothing proposition), reduced urban density problems, and an increased baseline level of economic activity that lubricates the economy and reduces the size of recessionary shocks.

&gt;If there's no incentive to get paid to survive why would I be inclined to work at all if I can get by on this 'basic income' handout?

In order to earn more wealth so that you can afford various luxuries that might beyond the means of the UBI alone.

But the important thing to keep in mind is that a lack of incentive to work *is not the problem* that western economies currently face. Especially since 2008, there are many millions of people who would *like* to have jobs and just can't find one. Labor is available in a greater quantity and higher quality than ever before, it's the *jobs* that are missing. And due to advancing automation, those jobs are probably never coming back.

"Well UBI would provide a huge amount of flexibility to people to decide how much time they want to spend working. Some people will absolutely pick the most awful jobs, because they are going to pay a lot more, since consumers with buying power will want to avoid doing unpleasant things, and workers with options are going to want to avoid shitty work, so dangerous and unpleasant tasks are going to get bid up. This already happens with unpleasant and dangerous and technical work. Guys who have to climb into awful holes or handle dangerous chemicals and have a job that requires some skill or knowledge are hard to come by in the current economy. It's why plumbers are paid so well, and people in municipal waste treatment engineering are paid even better.  


I think many people will look for an unpleasant job, that when they work 15-20 hours a week, plus their UBI, they are pretty comfortable. While it might not feel like it, Americans aside from the bottom 10% (which is more like a lot of people during their worst year, plus the mentally ill, rather than a chronic working slave caste, for the record) are surprisingly close to the value of spending power that having more doesn't really intrinsically make for a better life, and if we weren't so fucked on healthcare spending, I think a good chunk of Americans would actually be there. A lot of us of course, don't realize that, and we fixate on the ultra wealthy and celebrities and overall it's pretty unhealthy and  while I don't think UBI would solve that, it would provide the framework for people to take a breath, and reconsider their course in life if they ever tried to do that. I think many wouldn't even notice, would just spend 12k more every year, and do nothing different, but for those who want to make adjustments in their life, in skill/education, in location, or in work intensity, it provides a lot of flexibility for those that want it, and I think that's where the real magic is.

"&gt;&gt;This is just central planning with ""science"" in it. I am a scientist. The variation between how long we can hold our breath is massively different than the study of preference and happiness. 

Yes but we do have some data already on this and the more we task our scientist's with making these determinations through experiment, the more data we will have. 

For instance, there have already been (perhaps non scientific) experiments with a universal basic income on test subjects (I believe in Canada) that tells us how much of a burden is lifted on those subjects and the resulting life managability improvement. 

Again, the more we conduct these experiments, the more data we will have and the more our scientist's will be able to make accurate determinations.

Plus the whole idea of essentially arguing it won't work because there will always be some person who thinks they, say, need a billion mansions for their personal comfort is, to me, a poor argument.

We have historic evidence of the great English manor estates falling into disrepair because they were essentially too large to maintain without access to regular staff.

Now that right there should tell us something crucial and universal about property and house ownership: If your house and property require regular staff to maintain, it's too big. Barring specialized repairs, if you can't maintain it yourself or with you and the immediate family living there with you, it's too big. We have plenty of evidence that houses of a certain size can be managed without regular staff.

"This is why I'm in favour of a ""basic income"" which is a state-paid income to *all* adults regardless of anything else that is just enough to live on for an adult. It would allow so many more people to do things that don't pay well or at all - being a full time parent, being a full time activist or volunteer, working in charity situations and all that kind of stuff. I also like it for the idea of it voiding the need for unemployment benefits and all that kind of stuff which cuts down a *huge* amount of governmental expenditure on admin, rather than assessing everyone based on their work status, where they live, how many kids they are, what age they are, what they used to earn, etc, it's just ""give us evidence that you live in this country and are an adult, and give us your bank number"", but for me it's far more about putting value in things that can't really be quantified by saying you're an adult and you deserve to live, and if you want to earn more than this you can get a job, but if you can survive on this and you want to spend your time with your family, you should be able to do that.

I know it's a fairly radical idea (yes, I'm a socialist, yes, I know many people disagree with it and that's a-okay with me) but it would allow us to put **so much more** value into things that a lot of people would love to spend their time doing. Personally, I'm involved in political activism, crafts, writing, and hopefully in the future I'll have a family - but those have to be pushed to the side to afford to live, and considering my partner has the same interests, we'll have to negotiate how much each of us is allowed to do what we love and how much each of us has to work to afford to survive and have a family, since making your ""hobbies"" or interests your job can be quite challenging.

People like to surround themselves with all kinds of crap that they don't really need. The solution for most issues with ""overpopulation"" is soft downsizing. To make it easy it's better to start early. Overconsumption in theory is so easy thing to fix, but like you said it might never happen. But in that case we who know the way go to the wilderness, where imho we belong. No fancy pants bling bling and no fake smiles or other bs. Well nothing wrong with fishing villages or rural communities either.

Yeah I'm sceptical about humans getting close to the environment as a whole. It's gonna take a long time and by then our tech is probably on another level, so there's more options for everything. In any case nature is sadly gonna get the sharp end of the stick for a long time. We cut down trees and dig deep holes. Animals will die. Humans are idiots. 

There are plenty of alternatives, but the money is in what we see now. It's gonna take some sort of push to change all that. Consumer habits is a real force, so maybe... Also the next generation of technology, which is greener, is already waiting. But again what we have now is still profitable so it's going to be run as long as possible.

I say tech alot, but only to delight the crowd, to me it's one of the core problems. I try to minimize it personally. We seem to be in some sort of hurry to get somewhere, we want fast progress. I don't get why. There's no finish line. We should slow down and enjoy what we have now. After it gets boring, we can scrap some of it and continue our lives with a lighter load.

So maybe my solution to the problems we have now or might face in the near future is more philosophical one, but that's the easiest one and it's hard to go wrong with it.

I tried to get a nice quote here about overpopulation, but just ended up reading the wikipedia [article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation) about it, which is pretty good. There's really only two core issues - overconsumption and rapid population growth. Fix the consumption issues in the west, find a reasonable middle ground for the developing world. I and the experts seem to agree that the population growth issues are gonna fix themselves when asia and africa has the basic comforts of life, and they don't feel the need for a crowd of offspring to support them when they're old.

"I'm not sure exactly what you meant by a universal minimum income in your original post if you're against any kind of phasing out.

I think the simplest way to do this (and a more transparent way than the Ontario pilot was) would be to raise the Basic Personal Amount to $30-36k or so and thus have the UBI simply worked into the tax code for everyone to see.  This is similar to how Milton Friedman had envisioned it 55 years ago, where he was proposing a $3,000 max benefit when the basic deduction for his example family had been $6,000.  By raising up the bottom quintile and making the income tax lower for everyone, you could then enact higher regressive taxation akin to Europe without pushing people into poverty.   

The idea that we can fund a UBI for everyone without any claw back by eliminating current welfare supports means that we're going to end up with less money for those who need it, ie the 10-20% or so that are living in poverty or near the poverty line.  

I don't see how you could realistically envision that we would be able to fund giving every Canadian family $15,000-25,000 simply by phasing out current welfare programs.  Doing some quick google searches, there was [$134 billion in transfer payments to individuals in 2005 from the federal and provincial governments.](https://web.archive.org/web/20081104101532/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/govt05a.htm)  In 2006, there were 12.4 million Canadian households.  That would equal roughly $10,800 per household.  

I'd be curious as to which ones you would cut. [Go ahead and play with this spreadsheet I made in 10 minutes if you want to run the ten year old numbers.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sif8FBLxQEBS20ro7A_jm_oHlGU49va06M7gOOv_bps/edit?usp=sharing)",neutral,neutral

"There is a whole bunch of reasons that sort of coagulate into a big bowl of suck. 

Off the top of my head (as someone from the working class, though with a reaallllly lower middle class upbringing) there's:

* Authoritarianism - a whole lot of poor/working class people want to feel that they have a status in a hierarchy, that they are protected and someone with more authority makes decisions. This comes up time and again in studies on working class political outlooks.
* Linked: nationalism - people like the feeling of being part of a people, a nation , with a sense of defined identity. The concept of nation is often tied to a concept of a natural hierarchy.
* Institutionalism - working class people see links to certain institutions as being a sort of linked status. Have a cousin who is a cop? Does the family proud! Uncle who is a priest? That transfers. Even if they don't like generic cops (""they are just another gang"") they will still have loyalty to the institution and their connection to it.  This is, for example, how Trump and Boris Johnson were able to make great political hay out of the Black Lives Matter movements and the ""defund the police"" movements. 
* Linked: loyalty to the work. UK Labour have this weird mantra that pops up when people start talking about UBI - we are the party of the working class; to be working class, you must work.  Your gain status from being deemed a good worker, and preferably being not hugely ambitious. (""Ambition"" in many circles rapidly becomes ""doing political things"")
* narrowly defined success. Your cousin had some dodgy business, made money and now he's a property developer? Oh, nice. Your nephew is the top professor of Queer Theory in the big city? Eh, let's not talk about that. This means Trump et al make sense in a way someone else might not.
* Hostility to theoretical movements: the biggest and likely fatal split in the 20th century western left happens in the 1960s when young, university educated theorists co-opted the movement. The theorists had always been there, but you were meant to do that in your spare time. (Years before George Orwell said this of the English working class \[paraphrasing\] - what they really want is less work, more money, more free time and more beer. While this may sound patronising, its really a warning to the theorists - people want their lives to be more comfortable, not more complex)
* Split in the perception of labour: the modern populist reactionary gets a lot of hay out of complaining about out of touch elitist liberals who sip lattes. Look at them on their laptops.

There happens to be a lot of data on it - since there are trials of it happening around the United States - and while it isn’t a silver bullet, the gist appears to be that it decreases homelessness and crime while increasing student performance and community welfare. 

It turns out, when you give people enough money that they can repair their car AND pay their rent without getting a payday loan, they are able to actually pull themselves out of poverty and lead a fulfilling life. On top of that, not moving constantly makes poor students more successful in school and less truant.

"No offense but UBI is beneficial to you because you don't care about making more money, you only work to pay rent, and you'd like the ability to take months off from work. 

The other issue so many feel disgust against is the sense of entitlement for being born and no matter how you argue it, trying to call it morality, or a system that ends up benefiting all, it is in fact entitlement to benefit from others inventions and work. 

I as many others do not believe we are owed anything. I believe I was very lucky to be born in America and that by itself is such an amazing windfall vs where I could have ended up. 

Frankly, I don't feel anyone is entitled to the labor of others. If people want someone to blame, it should be their parents. 

You have two large groups who make up UBI supporters, those who do not work, for whatever reason and have very little, and those who do work but would prefer not to, and have no joy in their work. 

I don't feel the electric company owes me electricity, or the oil company owes me heat, or the doctor owes me an examination, or that scientists owe me pills. 

What I do like, is a system that rewards hard work and sacrifice but also allows those of us MANY MANY OF US who believe in giving back to do so and we have that now. 

We have groups that help pay peoples electric and heat, and doctors who work for free in their spare time, and scientists who work to invent cures with no goal of fame or money.

What can't be fixed is if someone says they'd really rather just paint all day, or fish, or play video games, etc and frankly that is A LOT of people.

"&gt; I don't know if you realise, but your tone is quite condescending. Not sure if that's in response to something I've said, but there's no need to be that way when we could have a friendly open minded conversation instead.

Hard not to be condescending when someone is not aware of a major tenet of their own ideology. I am the same way when talking religion to someone who has not read their own holy book but preaches its word just the same. 

&gt;I'm not a fan of the Koch brothers, but I don't see why I can't be a libertarian but still care about the environment. Milton Friedman was also for a tax to account for the negative externalities of pollution and it makes perfect sense to me.

Oh you can be. But you can also be a million other things that care about pollution. Libertarians care for pollution seems to be at the bottom of their priority list. Something to talk about, sure. But action? Nowhere near there. 

&gt;I don't think the intention of the UBI is to allow everyone to afford a certain lifestyle. So if someone is in a dire financial circumstance, then they might need to make lifestyle adjustments (including relocation) to make up for it. There's no reason why the UBI can't be raised over time as we become wealthier as a society.

Relocation costs money. How do I relocate myself when I am barely staying afloat with UBI? Plus the areas that has the resources I need (hospitals, schools, stores that i can walk to) tend to be more expensive. By moving disabled people to the countryside, you have lowered their rent but you also ensured that they will starve because they cannot afford to pay for an uber every time they need to go grocery shopping. Or they die from not having access to a specialized hospital since rural clinics are all about general practice.

UBI is not a magic bullet solution. I used to think so but i have been reading through the results of UBI experiments and as a result I have decided that UBI is not a solution yet. It is a step in the right direction, however. 

&gt;I would incentivise people to use a portion of their UBI 

And these incentives is how we ended up with the byzantine bureacracy of current welfare. Why is it that people think that we make things complicated for shits and giggles? There are always good reasons and complex problems that require complex solutions.

&gt;Again, I don't think Libertarians are all heartless and selfish.

Their actions speak otherwise.  

&gt; Personally I just think that libertarian principles are the optimal way to reach greatest average living standards. 

No proof of that whatsoever. Regulated mixed economies have shown greatest results. Overly regulated fail, under regulated also fail. 

&gt;How would you describe your ideology?

Practicality. Take a solution, think about it, experiment with it, apply it and look at results. People happy with results and costs? great. Next problem. 

I do not care about ideology whatsoever. If republicans offer greatest results then I will support them, and so on. Libertarians offer nothing, therefore they get ridicule from me. 

Take healthcare for example: I have practiced medicine on 3 continents in 7 different countries. Hands down, Europeans have the best system. Lower costs, higher results, least suffering. I needed to go an ED in Latvia, 60 euros and i was not even a citizen. 

In USA that would be 600 dollars minimum with insurance. And in middle east, I would stay home and patch myself up on my own because they would do more harm than good.

"And? The purpose of UBI is not to specifically make sure everyone can afford their rent or mortgage. It's to give everyone an equal leg up to help with that and many other basic expenses. For many people, it may cover their living expenses entirely, and those people can opt not to work if they want. If it won't cover your mortgage, that's something you'll have to figure out. If that means moving, you figure out how to pay for it. But you still get the same amount of money as everyone else. 

Edit: additionally, adding allowances for moving and related expenses would add new levels of bureaucracy and red tape to UBI, and the whole purpose of keeping it simple is to ensure there's as little red tape as humanly possible. Once you start adding exceptions and allowances here and there, it's a slippery slope to becoming a massive ineffective mess just like many government programs are now.

&gt; But that doesn't convince me it's the worse choice, just not a pleasant one. 

OK, but:

If you honestly think we'd be better letting these folks die or be desperate *outside* of the confines and context of pure economics, and think of economics as a legitimate reason to not help them. I'm inclined to think you are fundamentally not like me as a person. Even ignoring emotional arguments, that you are wholly and completely alien to me, like some sort of AI or spider. And that because of this, our differing reference frames of ethical philosophy prevents us from ever coming to a full agreement.

**I'm not saying that is what you think, as you have not directly expressed this view, but that is the destination where you are leading me to.**

&gt; Disclaimer, I don't actually think capitalists contribute nothing, but that's an entirely different argument. 

I technically don't either. They are effectively doing a management job. Doesn't mean they should get the pay that they effectively give themselves. Its like letting congress vote for its own pay raise, only worse in its broad effects.

&gt; keep in mind the point is whether or not tolerating the latter is more beneficial than non tolerance of the latter.

Indeed, which is why whether or not a UBI is a good idea is actually generally considered independent of socialism and often socialists are only for a welfare system under capitalism because they see it as a counter measure to the thievery of the capitalist class, rather than a genuine interest in protecting lumpen-proles.

&gt; Shitty thought experiment time. 

&gt; I wanted to say what I'm about to say at first, but decided I would wait to see how you answered. These values, while okay to have, aren't all encompassing. What I mean is, there is a lot of other things that we can ""value"" that don't have to be derived from either of these positions. An example could be individuality. There's no guarantee that individuality will maximize happiness and minimize death, but ultimately I only live this life once and dammit if I'm not happy, fixing that becomes top priority. 

But individuality on its own for me *isn't* a terminal value, at all. Its a derived ethical value *from* my terminal values (individuality for many does lead to happiness do to the liberating feeling it can bring), as well as a pragmatic value (In terms of economics, the person often with the best idea of what they need to improve their own happiness is themselves, which is why I am against top down state communism).

If I were forced to add a third terminal value BTW, I'd probably be variety/accuracy (basically, difference and science) of experiences. But this value would still be placed under the other 2. And this would indeed reinforce my sentimental approval of individualism on top of the first 2 values. But its definitely under my first 2. A serial killer/torturer might contribute a lot to science after he's caught and might inspire unique creative works based on his actions that never would have come about, but I'd still be against his serial killing.

They absolutely are all encompassing in the sense that if I think a policy will go against these principles, directly or indirectly down the line due to our system whatever it may be, then it makes no sense to *not* be against it. The problem mostly is knowing whether any policy will authentically be a positive for these values, because life and everything in it is really complicated.

&gt; I don't think we need to believe in free will to think some people 'deserve' something. You think a guy who contributes nothing to society should still deserves to have his needs met. We can base the criteria for what people deserve around anything, doesn't have to be free will.

You've made a critical misunderstanding of me. **I do not think a lumpen prole deserves to have his needs met in the strictest sense of ethics. Because I don't believe in a ""deserve""** I think that the suffering and death caused to them and others from their suffering and death however, goes against terminal value numero uno. A big no-no for me. EDIT: to make it more clear, I'm talking about what would happen to them without a welfare system of some sort.

&gt; Determinism holds that everything that happens happens for an explainable reason, and that it was already determine to happen because of prior conditions. We can then deduce that free will is an illusion. Quantum mechanics undermines determinism in this way. Turns out some things happen by probabilities. So not everything can be determined like we thought. Well, if we know not everything can be determined, how could is our deduction that the free will we observe an illusion? We don't call the quantum fluctuations an illusion because of determinism, so why call the free will we observe an illusion because of determinism? 

I've pointed out elsewhere that randomness doesn't undermine my position that there is no free will. My main argument is that free will as a concept doesn't actually make any sense. What exactly is your 'free will', free *from*? Why does randomness produce evidence for free will? What is free will really?",neutral,neutral

"Yeah it is a Yang talking point---and he is open about the types of adjustments that he suggests me should make to cover the rest that's not in the VAT, and I agree with much of his proposals---obviously we don't need social security of we have a 12k per year UBI. VATs are great because we know the work (Europe and most of the world aren't collapsing) and they are by definition progressive, since it targets consumption itself----rich people will pay far more into the system than they will get out of it, etc.

I think the biggest thing that has to be determined (which I am not convinced of yet), isn't how we pay for it but if we actually need a UBI or not. Yang makes a pretty doomeresque take in his book that we need it because of automation, but I think that's just not at all clear if you read what actual economists are saying---and it isn't clear that we won't just keep finding more jobs that are specialized positions that we want humans to do---there might be tons of jobs that don't have humans doing them now but we will discover that we prefer it. Like service seems like it is almost always better from a human when you take the novelty of automation away, we are never going to want caregiver robots, etc. etc. Even major decisions at companies and in the federal government---at least if we maintain democratic societies will probably require humans.

"Let me try to dissect the argument a little bit here. 

Argument: Giving everyone X amount of money will overall increase costs by amount X, in this case $1000 a month. 

Short explanation, since the money is not being printed (increasing money supply) there is no inflation. $1000/month will not increase costs for Americans and will be beneficial to over 90% of the populace.

Long explanation, redistribution of wealth via UBI would likely cause a small amount of inflation due to the increased velocity of money, money would circulate in the economy more yes, but not as drastically as if you just printed money, and overall it’s not really significant. The concern about price increases is mainly about taxation, which I’ll go into more depth here. 

What you’re more concerned about is the idea that prices of everything would go up, and you’d just end up paying the same amount as you did before (if your income went up 10% but everything you spend money on went up 10%, your income increase is effectively 0).

There’s a lot of nuance associated with this, but speaking rather broadly, companies don’t increase prices directly based on income of consumers, but the supply and demand of goods in an area, essentially profit.  All things being equal, the increase in money from consumers would constitute an increase in demand, and thus price, however, not all demand curves are the same. 

Take for example food. McDonald’s can’t really raise its prices too far, or else you would just end up going to Burger King, or a regular restaurant, or even home cook your food. Compared to say medical care, you don’t go price shopping hospitals. We call things that vary largely in demand along with price elastic goods, and we call goods that vary slightly in demand along with price inelastic goods. 

What does this mean? Any taxes on goods like video games or Netflix will largely be borne by the company, and taxes on goods like water will be borne by consumers. So in a worst case scenario, you pay an additional 10% tax on purchases, meaning you would have to spend $120,000 a year to lose the money. However, as discussed earlier, companies will bear part of the cost, and realistically prices would only increase 5-8%. This is assuming a flat VAT tax too, which Yang is not advocating for, he’s advocating for a progressive VAT. 

Glad that you can discuss this, there is a reason thousands of economists have signed on in support of a negative income tax back in 1970s under Nixon, which is a variant of UBI.",neutral,neutral

"I'm surprised you're so willing to accept a utopian vision of the future for a fan of a cyberpunk game like Deus Ex.

People have in human history defined their lives by what work they perform -- meaning comes from responsibility. With no need to produce to survive, what will life look like?

You can balk at the creator's view of progressivism, or disagree with the premise, but I don't think it's a bad starting point, and I think the controversy is overblown (the creator has noted that his views have evolved over time, and I doubt this will be some kind of ""antifeminist"" manifesto).

These pilot tests are moronic. You simply cannot study the effects of this type of economic change on a small scale... in any regard.

Also pay won't need to cover survival plus spending money anymore, with the survival part covered. 

Will some jobs pay zero? Well sure, some already do, especially the ones we call volunteering, and we do expect more volunteering under a UBI. But that's what we want, right? Freeing people to pursue their own interests without fear of poverty?

So just some thoughts to your responses:

1 I think there is already stratification of prestige white collar works that require a degree and blue collar work that does not.

Think of all the scientists and researchers we’ve lost to tuition, all the inventions and discoveries we’ve lost to fear of student debt. It’s heartbreaking and ultimately it’s bad for our economy.

2 I’m all about a public option — and this might sound counter intuitive — but I think that running a public option without bringing in all the healthy and low risk customers will be MORE expensive and more likely to fail than a single, streamlined and efficient system that maximizes our healthcare dollars.

3 agree we need to expand benefits. I really like UBI and so I understand the appeal of Yang. I just think it’s a bandaid solution for some of the dysfunctional parts of our society.

4 they’re going to try and block it no matter who is in office. They don’t want to give any democrats a W. Might as well go for the whole enchilada and put the pressure on republicans to explain to their constituents why they’re such assholes.

5 same as above — I think it will cost more than just streamlining under m4a.

"&gt; Ok, so society doesn't value librarians. Society greatly values electrical engineers.

You don't know that unless you give every member of society a say about who is valued and listen to what they say with that. Money is that say today, a rather useful construct.

&gt; Does the librarian get as much as the engineer?

Maybe? It depends on who has the ability to express value as customer, and how much more demand from there is for finalized products/services, at a given point in time, for either of their services that build into such, vs the availability of people willed to do the work needed in that process.

&gt; If so, who pays more?

Whoever commands the greater premium for the scaricty of their labor contributions pays more into the UBI scheme, because after all, we create the value of the occupation by paying for it to be begin with, and getting lucky that demand for your occupation is greater when you happen to be available to do that work, I mean it's hard to take credit for all of that. Some of it might be intelligent planning on the side of the individual, however.

Hence a percentage based similar tax *rate* on income seems sensible. Though there's also a case to be made for greater progressiveness in taxation, the more your income depends on economies of scale and network effect (often part of capital income though might also be integrated with labor income if you're famous artist or something), rather than your work. The georgist case points in the direction of a land value tax to be collected yearly, on land, to achieve this, if you like a more libertarian approach to morally important progressive taxation.

&gt; Or do they not contribute the same?

Who contributes how much is dependent on who actually makes how much money, and by what factors of their own doing.

Why would people who differently benefit from scarcity of labor and potentially other factors pay the same flat sum? This isn't an insurance, a tax is about returning what you're owing society.

&gt; If they both pay in the same, what's the point? Dollar in dollar out.

Some people who benefit more from the land or from other unearned factors would pay more, some who tendencially only sell their labor, they pay less.

&gt; If the electrical engineer pays more, congrats, you're advocating the theft of one person's labor for another person who isn't natively valued.

Whoeever actually earns more (edit:) most likely also actually pays more, because we don't have a perfect market and it sure isn't owed to the inability of the people to assume different roles within it. As long as wages aren't in an equilibrium between people with similar potential, a case for a market failure being present is to be made. (edit: though it would be cool to go after the root causes of unequal pay, tax those, uneven distribution of returns from land (physical as well as economic opportunity), on a case by case basis, as much as the complexity of figuring out those relations might be quite huge. A modest Land Value Tax collected yearly, based on the unimproved value of the land, e.g. not the stuff that's actually on it. Rather, an empty plot generates the same total cost as a skyscraper if they're right next to each other/similarly desirable by location; that would be a good start.)

&gt; That's artificial, and the hallmark of communist ideals.

Today I learned that a flat tax is communistic.

&gt; If you believe in Communism, that's fine, embrace it. But stop with the pretend re-branding to make yourself feel hip.

Communism makes a statement about who owns the means of production, including labor. Universal income is a commitment to letting the individual take control of their own labor, in whatever way they consider most worth their time, be it for a profit or non-profit, if desired.

It's not communism to let people work whatever they think is worthwhile. Also a tax financed UBI doesn't actually change the ownership nor who has immediate control of non-labor property.

edit: From the conversation with the OP within this thread, I learned that communism is only arrived at, if somehow everyone decides to drop out of the workforce and consequently the state might chose to force people to use their labor one way or another, as much as it seems more sensible to first empower people to resist this kind of exploitation which is indeed taking place today unfortunately (and increasingly so), and then see if the state will actually manage to push through with that.

"[This](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=J10jKdPRN9A) is a pretty good critique of UBI. Personally I don't understand how it is much different than raising minimum-wage, I imagine the market will simply adjust via hyperinflation and ultimately it would solve nothing. I'm not against either idea, but we already know elected officials have failed to keep minimum wage in line with inflation, why should we expect them to keep basic income in line with inflation?

In my opinion it would make more sense to give people free housing, food, education and healthcare. Of course that's never going to happen, but it would be a much better solution long-term.

Frankly I don't think many of our politicians are actually looking for solutions to poverty and I don't think we're going to vote our way out of this situation.

We have a labor participation rate that's just over 60% (in the United States but the story is similar all over). The highest it has ever been was in 1997, I believe, when it was 67%. So in rough terms half of those that can work are not, and if my observation of the people in my life is a reflection of the larger population then it's not because they are voluntarily not working. If you look at this trend overtime there hasn't been a lot of variance, so a long-term solution that doesn't involve politicians that can change their mind in a 180 fashion every four years is required. 

So since we know that regardless of economic situations a good number of people simply will never be employed we should factor that into the system (if we absolutely insist there must be a system ). That sounds like a good idea to give a basic income except where is that money going to go? It's not going to go into home ownership because that's simply not affordable on a basic income, it is most certainly going to go to rent and basic necessities.

As a result the recipients of a basic income would be subject to market forces, if they were simply given a Home unconditionally and were not required to pay property taxes or  HOA they couldn't be priced out of their neighborhood for any reason and their housing security would be much better.

Not that I think there's much of a chance of any of this happening, I very much expect business as usual until it simply is no longer sustainable.

So should he hire human labor just to employ them even though they'd just slow production down?  Eh, just give it to them so they can remain happy and not distrup society.  So, a basic income is created.

Even those that say, ""a person has to work"", cannot defend the fact that it doesn't make sense if them (humans) working only creates ineffenciancies.  We believe they must work now because that is the most efficient and fair way to distribute wealth while providing for the highest, overall, output.

Like, workers are normally on much thinner 'profit margins' than the capitialists they work for. The breakdown seems to be in that balance, any withdrawl of labor significant enough to 'cripple' profits would seem to my, admittedly amateur, eye, to almost by definition, hurt wages. Its like the regressive tax thing, that day of lost wages means much more to the worker than it does to the capitailist. And the capitialist is getting some return by saving on labor costs, and meanwhile, workers still need to be purchasing necessities so, just like with UBI, capitialists profit there too.

And I dont think it is accurate to call the spending necessary to sustain subsistence living during a strike enough to ""fatten the profits"" for capitalist.

Anyway, it feels obvious to me (although I guess it is not) that it would be much easier for workers  to withhold labor via a strike or via a reduction of work hours if workers had some income that wasnt derived from wages.

It's pretty helpful to us and will definitely ease the period when we're on parental/maternity leave when our joint income will go down.

&gt;Not exactly, the insurance company gets billed and they pay what they want.

No, the hospitals are not obligated to take insurance of any type.  The Insurance companies negotiate prices with the Hospitals.  That's why some places don't take all insurance.  

&gt;which is why shit like Asprin costs so much in the hospital.

Things like Aspirin cost so much in the hospital because of the Hospital paymaster system.  Some insurers will reimburse of Aspirin, some won't.  Because the hospital doesn't know what individual insurers will reimburse for, they send a blanket bill with inflated prices to the insurance company, which then corrects the bill with what they will pay per the negotiated agreement.  The hospital does this to maximize payment for their services.

So those who do indeed choose not to work would be adding to demand and reducing the size of the JG employment buffer.

What would need to happen would be that the JG employment buffer may need to increase.

Maybe this is fine. Maybe it is not fine.

In the case of just a BIG, the involuntary unemployment buffer would need to increase. If the BIG is indexed to some livable amount of income, there's a distinct possibility that you couldn't get it to increase through taxation or cuts to other spending programs. You may just end up reducing output substantially before any reality sets in that half of the population isn't working and the basic income has to be substantially large for it to purchase goods and services in the midst of a shortage. If you can't increase the buffer, then you can't stop inflation.

With a BIG delivered to people who refuse (and why not, maybe we want to as a society, allow people to refuse work), it may be that the buffer needs to be increased. More taxes might be necessary in order to reduce private sector employment (at incomes above the wage floor). So to me, it's kind of not a good thing, but whatever. You don't know the size the JG buffer needs to be until you hit inflation. But there could be stigma. There will always be stigma for people both receiving benefits, being capable of working, but choosing not to work, regardless of whether or not others are receiving them as well. So I think political issues would be there regardless.

I think you can have the outcome of eliminating poverty without UBI and with JG. I don't see it as necessary if at the end of the day, you will need to have some amount of people in either a JG pool or an unemployment buffer (a reserve army of the unemployed). It seems feasible to me that paid vacation times, benefits, paid sabbaticals, pushing the work week down, would all be better ways of achieving what the UBI wants to achieve without doing it.

"Has anybody against this paid a thought to important factors of this beyond just what the upfront cost of the program would be?

This would make any form of welfare payment obsolete, and thus dramatically reduce such spending both on the programs themselves AND on the administration of them. That is a HUGE cost savings in its own right. CERB didn't do that, it was over and above what existed already;

This would certainly result in taxes paid on the amount between the personal exemption and how much the UBI would pay out. So some of that UBI would be paid back in taxes in any case, unless the personal exemption is eliminated as a result, which would be a possibility;

Giving poor people money is, from a macroeconomic standpoint, the absolute best thing to do as an economic stimulus because they spend every nickel of it, with very little of it being left in the bank. This results in a huge amount of new consumer spending in many fields;

Canadians are already, per capita, huge entrepreneurs, and know that one would never starve as a result of a UBI would almost certainly result in a massive wave of new business creation, particularly if job losses from outside circumstances (such as a pandemic....) force people to have to work for themselves;

From a societal standpoint, if job growth isn't capable of reducing unemployment post-pandemic, the sat thing anyone needs is a wave of people without jobs who struggle just to survive. Such people are much more prone to addiction problems and criminal activity, which beyond being hurtful to society is disproportionately expensive to deal with. It would be much less costly to have a UBI for such people rather than paying for addiction treatments and additional health care services and extra policing and justice system costs.

"The OP is taking standard examples of in-group bias and painting these to be defining features of conservatism rather than as features of groups.

Yes, there are people who are attempting to construct an aristocracy with themselves at the head, and those people have discovered that a conservative populace is much easier to manipulate into what they want. But those people are not conservatives, they are *oligarchs*.

Conservatism is about making everything as similar as possible and giving everything a place. Yes you would be given a role to fill upon birth, but your role would give you meaning to your life and mean that you don't have to fight for your place. There would be no discrimination against different people because there would be no different people. Yes, these things are kind of horrible once you start extrapolating them, but thing is that they're *productive*. Societies that followed these roles generated more resources and had more children, which turned into more productive adults which allowed them to out-compete other societies.

More liberal social systems only become successful once we disconnect the productivity of an individual from raw labour. The greatest of science and maths comes from more even societies where there is more freedom of thought. As such, the greatest possible triumph for liberal societies depends not on ""beating"" conservatives, because you can't beat an ideology that is so successful, but on developing systems that render them obsolete. Like a universal basic income which is supported by full automation of the production cycle. We could call it FULLY AUTOMATED LUXURY SPACE COMMUNISM!

"&gt; I do most if not all of these things anyway.

Then you get 2-3x the treadlife warranty. A 70k-mile warranty tire lasts you 140k-210k miles. Others get 10k miles out of the same set of tires.

What's the treadlife warranty on your tires, and how many miles do they actually last you?

&gt; In economics some activities are elastic

Like tire-rotation, balancing, and alignment intervals. Some people never have their wheels balanced outside of intial tire installation, and never rotate tires at all and never have their vehicles aligned (even when new tires are installed). Others rotate and rebalance, and have the vehicle aligned, every 5k miles.

Name your intervals:

* tire rotation

* wheel balance

* alignment

&gt; What you propose would generate tax revenue

Not if the tax were **revenue neutral**.

&gt; but it would not reduce the tire wear much if at all.

Let's check: https://www.statista.com/statistics/276159/passenger-tire-shipments-in-the-united-states/

&gt; In 2018, around 217 million replacement passenger tires were shipped in the United States

Those tires, plus some 70k tires on the 17 million new vehicles purchased each year, last a collective 3.2 trillion miles: https://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx

That's 11k miles per tire, or 45k miles per set of 4. Is that how long your tires last?

&gt; If tires got really expensive people would likely skip alignments and rotation

Which would cause their overall driving costs to increase.

If the tax were **revenue neutral** via Basic Income, then consumers would be receiving equal shares of the collective tax money back, to do with as they wished. They would therefore be financially free to have frequent balancings, rotations, and alignments.

&gt; expensive tires would lead to prolonged usage

Which is why a tire tax would need to be accompanied by a raising of the legal tread depth limit from the current 2/32nds of an inch to, say, 4/32nds of an inch (which many experts recommend as a safe minimum anyway).

&gt; You should probably legislate better compound formulas

No, because the market could promote that more-efficiently with a simple revenue-neutral tire tax.",neutral,neutral
"I do. Using my own country as an example, which just so happens to be the country with the highest taxes in the world, Sweden, I get these numbers:

2015 our budget was just short of 900 billion kronor, which translates to roughly 90 billion euro. In an *extremely* liberal and short-handed way I counted the costs of every government expenditure that had anything even remotely to do with giving money to people or organising said giving. That is, the real number would definitely be lower. 

So, even with this exaggerated number, if you were to remove all of those expenditures and instead provide that money equally to every Swedish citizen monthly over the year, everyone would get roughly €350 per month, which is in no way enough to make any kind of living. To make a comparison, the amount you get on welfare is more in the realm of €7-900. And that's not easy to live off on. 

Now, if you removed *every* expenditure of our government and freed up the whole €90 Billion to be distributed to the people as UBI, that is, **if you basically disbanded the Swedish government but (somehow) still collected taxes**, no health care, no police, no military, no infrastructure, no nothing, only UBI, then everyone would get around €833 per month, which depending on your rent is less than welfare and for most people would not cover their monthly bills for basic living, eating and utilities.

The only way to fund UBI is to access the fruits of our steadily increasing productivity, which has since around the 70-ies not been seen by anyone but the 1%. Median real income has been stagnant, only ever so slightly outpacing inflation, and working hours have gone *up*, while employment has gone down. All the while productivity has more than doubled. This is the missing variable. A great black hole that sucks up all of our gains as a society and puts them in a place where they never end up helping anyone but a select few. All the while burning out the common man with crazy working hours and stress to squeeze every ounce of productivity from him, while others are hungry for work.

My daughter goes to a school in a highly vaccinated and low transmission area so while last year was stressful, this year, things have felt much more manageable in terms of covid fear. 

My newfound regular income has allowed me to turn my previous job back into my hobby and I've been more passionate about making and working on music than I was doing it fulltime for the last 4 or 5 years.

Moneywise, I'm better off than I have been in a while because some of my event gigs have now come back and I'm essentially getting some serious supplementary income from performances again.

My biggest issue now is time as I don't have the time to work on all my side hustles and projects that I did back when I only really worked 3-4 evenings a week.

As is, I’ve forced myself to only take 1 gig a weekend as I need at least a day off for family time…

Not really. Bernie had a strong populist message, tons of political experience, and polled well early on. Yang has none of that.

The fund can strategically auction off natural resource extraction rights and sell unclaimed land. Or it can hold on to them if it thinks they will appreciate over time. Or it can take out loans against these assets and invest that.

The Sovereign Wealth Fund would also receive proceeds from taxes on negative externalities (such as carbon pollution).

Then from the returns of the fund I would pay a Universal Basic Income, which would grow as the fund grows.

"Id agree with you if upward mobility wasn’t already so difficult considering 70% of people live paycheck to paycheck. Income increases actually increase demand for goods. Obviously theres a point of diminishing returns but you have to be insane to think that the federal min of $7.25 is anywhere close to hitting that. Theres tons of conflicting studies on the effects of min wage increases in Seattle, but what was found recently was there was almost no impact on employment when they raised to to $11. After when they raised it to $13 there was a 6.9% decline in the hours worked. However they saw an average increase of $10 in earnings a week. Eventually automation will take over and we need to think of how better to get people ready for life than the pitfalls of our current K-12.

"Inflation usually happens when there is an increase in the supply of money. If the Freedom Dividend were to be funded by printing more money, than yes, there would be massive inflation. But if it is funded by redistributing the money already in the economy, like in Andrew's plan, there will be no significant inflation. 

It is likely that some companies will increase their prices in response to people having more buying power. However, consumers will still be price-sensitive so there will still be competition between firms that will keep prices in check. It's not like all of a sudden people don't care about paying $1,000 more for a product or service just because they have an extra $1,000.

A lot of the need to use those programs could be reduced by flat out giving people money, and you could reduce administrative bloat due to many of these programs.

1. What audience should be the primary benefactors of this program? (Usually low income individuals)
2. How is money for UBI generated? Sales tax, corporate tax, or a resource reallocation?

2. You need to take money from one pocket to put into another. And I know the answer is going to be ""just tax the rich more"". But that only goes so far until the rich get gatvol, and leave. You can't tax someone who's not here. So although a noble pursuit, in the context of South-Africa we are close to the limits of what we can take from one pocket to put into another.

"It’s easy. Hostage situation. 

We had 3 major eras in our country all ending In bloodshed and we are waiting for the next revolution 

The era of settlement saw the genocide of natives so that the wealthy colonists could fight a civil war with their king. It wasn’t a revolution, it was a civil war between wealthy land owners and wannabe wealthy land owners. Sure, there were some folks who fought for true independence (my ancestor was one, son of the American revolution here), but he died a poor revolutionary colonel. 

The second era was the real revolution. When the wealthy land owners wanted to claim “states rights” to keep their wealth by treating black humans as non humans. It was a revolution to break the chains of authoritarian and feudal rule. Notice, I said revolution not civil war. It was breaking norms. 

The third and last era was the industrial era. The wealthy again were in charge by pitting workers against each other to create a toxic sense of success and that constant work = success. Making children work to live, and unsafe work conditons so the same authoritarian bosses would get richer on someone else’s labor. It was met with unions and bloodshed vs groups like the union busting pinkertons. 

Which brings us to the modern era. The neo-capitalist feudal era. Big business wormed their way into government after the industrial era when they realized the people United were dangerous. So, control the people with their own government. They lobbied to buy politicians to exact their will and removed policy after policy that Woolf prevent them from taking more land and power. Eventually business became “too big to fail” and if they did, it would take wealth out of our governments pockets and hurt the image of politicians to lose votes. And we have hit a point of no return. Big business owns our government, our policy, and our livelihood. We became used to saying we are “lucky” to live in the greatest Country, pledge allegiance to a country that doesn’t pledge allegiance back, sends ifs children to fight wars for profit over land and resources to again make the lords even more wealthy. 

They own everything and have a major say in how we operate. And now instead of operating from behind the scenes they’re propping up their own messiahs in D.C. to again pit us against one another and remain divided instead of revolting. They play identity politics to keep us separated instead of United. 

We don’t have universal healthcare because there is profit in illness and death 

We don’t have universal basic income because the lords refuse to pay their share of taxes, that’s for peasants 

We have stupid laws with victimless crimes that punish poor and middle class with fines. Remember kids If punishment is just a fine ifs for us, not for them

&gt;Automation is likely to continue, even accelerate in non-customer facing jobs as machine costs decrease and ability increases. 

I agree, which is my point because your post initial made it seem like UBI to create that trend. Automation doesn't need UBI to be kickstarted; the internal strive for increased efficiency has been doing just that all on its own.

&gt;As for customer facing jobs, I think market forces will decided if people are ok dealing with automated positions or not, isn't t-mobile using Dwight from The Office to advertise that they have real humans on their customer support phone lines?

All it takes is one affordable Turing test passing robot to make the vast majority of customers oblivious. A customer calling support just wants their issue resolved, and the current automated support systems can be a bit too rigid.

The other side of the coin is the explosions of kiosks for ordering. A human can forget something or misinterpret. A machine isn't going to forget and directly and specific relays what the individual inputs.

&gt;And we legit have no idea what the new fields will be.

Specific fields, no, but we have a good idea of what *type* of fields they'd be because the goal of implementing automation is to remove any activity that can be broken down to a series of relatively easily repeatable steps. And that's the problem because the vast majority of jobs in our economy can be broken down into relatively easily repeatable steps (assuming the human follows those steps).

&gt; The industrial revolution saw the rise of machine operatoes who had to have some education.

The only education for the vast majority of industrial revolution workers came from the Foreman telling you how to operate the machine. But see, simply operating the machine is not going to be enough (and already isn't in many circumstances), its the creative application of problem solving and the engineering smarts to fix the broken machine.

"Well yea, working in a group will give you much better chance at survival then alone.... but ""fit"" isn't usually used to mean that you fit well with a group or enviornment, but physical/mental fitness, animals who are strong or fast have better chance at survival, or like monkeys with longer arms can get more fruit so evolution favors monkeys with long arms. 

We are animals, but what I meant is that humans have grown beyond the old rules for survival and evolution... we don't struggle as much for food or shelter cause we can make our own. Humans prob won't evolve anymore other then mentally or artifical evolution like genetic modification. 

I'd have to disagree with you about whats best for us psychologically. Competition gives people incentive to create new or better inventions, and be rewarded for doing so. Have you ever heard sayings like ""a busy mind is a happy mind"" or ""an idle mind is the devils playground""... thats cause if you don't have a job or purpose in life and something to keep you busy, you get lost in your thoughts or lose motivation and that is how people get depressed. Work keeps you busy and feel like you are contributing to society. 

The problem is if you work too much and don't have time for hobbies or to pursue creative projects... which is also important for mental health. But I don't think that a new generation with less job opportunities would be good for us... even if these people have basic income to help them pay for rent and stuff, a bunch of young people who don't work at all will not mature and grow as people.

Let's run with the proposed idea of UBI that was never really argued correctly because they don't want voters to start thinking ahead.  Yang's idea was $1000 a month I think.  The amount doesn't really matter to the point, what matters is the end.  We'll start with the most simple and unlikely consequence of the idea.  Since necessities have the most value,  when you pump that much disposable income into the economy,  necessities are the first to increase costs.  $800 rent quickly become $1800 rent. People will pay it because you need shelter.  The week be others that charge less to pick up the fallout,  but pretty much everybody is young to maximize the profit as well as they can. 

The reality is that your rent will probably slide up around $500, transportation and fuel prices will increase to get some of that disposable income as well.  Wages will not increase because you already have more money (and,  they already pretty much don't increase anyway). This will result in even more of your tax dollars ending up in the elites' hands so they can spread their influence further. 

The reality is that if you want a stable economy, you do have to regulate profit margins by industry.  And you can ease or tighten these regulations to steer the economy (and unemployment) in a way you see fit. 

The reality is that even when Democrats have power,  they don't really do shit to help the masses.  If they cared, they'd have long- since implemented sweeping changes from 2009-2011. Minimum wage would have been implemented,  state minimum unemployment standards would have definitely greatly increased.

The one silver lining about the pandemic might be that it's prepared people for a state of being out of work and economic upheaval, as well as significantly changing people's minds on stimulus packages from the government. 

It's still very early, but I guarantee the cogs have started to rotate and even if people aren't talking they're thinking about it.

"

Basic income under capitalism is a terrible idea for two reasons. 

1) It still leaves power in the hands of the capitalists, so they would likely either never grant one(it is after all a transfer of wealth away from their class) , or make it just enough to appease a few people, but not actually do much. Either way, the amount and distribution would be their choice to make, not ours. 

2) The labor that funds a BI has to come from somewhere, so it would continue to be funded off the backs of poorer workers in poorer countries. They already are bearing the burdens of economic imperialism, just so that richer countries can bug cheap consumer products, but them literally funding a basic income would drive yet another wedge between the workers living in welfare state BI countries, and imperialized ones. 

Under socialism /communism, basic income would be a matter of course, since all goods and services are democratically controlled, preferably by direct democracy, and put to use serving human needs. ""from each according to her ability, to each according to her needs"".

"Normal goods aren't going to rise in prices much. You're not raising the cost of production like 15 MW would. Yes, demand will go up, but supply isn't a problem for the most part. Businesses tend to prefer to sell more, so they'll increase production and keep prices low. The inflation areas that are already occurring need to be dealt with individually.

Alaska actually had a higher inflation rate compared to the rest of America before they implemented their dividend in 1982. After they started receiving their UBI, inflation rate actually became lower than the rest of the states. A study on a Mexican town also found that it didn't cause inflation. Most other studies probably weren't large or secluded enough to study inflationary effects.

Putting money in the hands of the people will have a few other effects that will help maintain rent cost:

It'll trigger economic growth in less populated or less appealing areas where high rental demand isn't a problem, causing gradual migration to less dense areas. Overall, there is a massive surplus of vacant homes in America.

It will also create more home buyers as most renters are looking to purchase a home and many of those are millennials. For instance, there will be newly weds with an extra 24k a year. If they have the type of family where parents/grandparents can help out, then they can easily purchase a home. There will also be millennials who will group together to invest in housing. Combined with affordable housing and relaxation on zoning regulations, rent demand will decrease over time.

It will also create incentive for growth in the rental market. We know that rent control can have counter intuitive effects, making housing shortages worse. The opposite would be putting money in the hands of the people, giving companies the incentive to invest in this field (see Google Homes or WikiHouses).

* provide breakfast and a take home dinner options for children in school.  Nobody american child should be food insecure.
* give tax payer money to any not for profit working on food insecurity.
* double or triple spending on k to 12 educational spending.
* fund opt-in experimental educational programs and measure success.
* universal healthcare.

One of the reason people are poor (NOT the old reason, but one reason) is because they are addicted to drugs.  another reason is mental illness.  Another reason is a poor value system.  Another is poor disipline, spending money foolishly.  You cannot solve those problems by giving them money.  I don't know what portion of poor people can be helped with money, but its definitely not 100% (and its definitely not 0%).  but I know everyone needs food, clean water, an education, and medical care.

of course a big reason too is that people are trapped in a cycle of poverty.  You cannot make investment in your future because you are too poor right now.  You can't worry about studying algebra when you are worried about getting your next meal.  That problem you can solve with UBI.  But you can also solve it with other social programs.

Honestly this is a job that used to be done by churches, Mosques, buddhist templates, etc.  But at least in america, these guys seems to have completely failed at that.  I probably would give 10% of my money to the church if it mostly went towards helping people and building a supportive community.  But closer to zero percent is used for helping people so fuck that.

With sufficiently impactful redistribution funneling money in to a UBI, no one is under duress to work any job they don't want to.

The Racial Economic Equality plan is fine from a very neoliberal perspective, but I think reparations is the actually progressive choice here.

I would recommend ""On Fire: The Burning Case for a Green New Deal"" by Naomi Klein to really get a good sense of the scope and severity of the looming existential disaster we're facing.

That's great he's put Bernie's staff on committees. Are these committees agreeing that M4A is the most sensible, cost-saving policy? If not they're still fundamentally neoliberal.

Also, decriminalizing marijuana rather than legalizing it is laughable.

It's great that we're decriminalizing it but we really need to be doing is the hard work needed to right the wrongs that have been going on for so long.

"UBI ""will allow people to dare more, we would see more entrepreneurs, start-ups and it would basically erase poverty and save many lives""?

How about this: UBI will allow the lazy to be lazy.  Who among us hasn't expressed the opinion that, if they won the lottery, they wouldn't just quit their job, and never work again?  

&gt;it would be a great stop to corporate exploitation of the working class, as there wouldn’t need the “need” to work, and one would only work in an interesting field/properly compensated workplace

That's one way to put it. Another might be: If no one needs to work, then no one *will* work. And companies will go out of business. Particularly smaller companies that cannot afford to raise their salaries enough to compete with 'free money for nothing!'   People already talk about how smaller businesses are driven out by large mega-corps, this would kill them entirely.

Oh, and this goes for the 'entrepreneurs, start-ups' that would supposedly spring up out of nowhere- they would have a hard time finding workers, and wouldn't be able to afford to pay people enough. 

As for financing UBI...

If we assume *no one* quits their job and lives of of UBI, then the situation is exactly like it is today, *without* UBI. So, why bother with the UBI?  It's not leading to the benefits you listed, and it's costing a lot. 

On the other side, let's assume that what I say is true to the extreme- that 100% of people decide to not work, and just live off the UBI.  Where do they get that UBI? From the government. Where does the government get their money? From taxes.  And with no people working, there can be no companies in existence. No companies to tax. So the government needs to earn the tax money it needs in order to hand out the UBI to the people... by taxing the people. 'Here's your $1000... I'm taxing you $1000 to pay for it!'  

Not to mention, who is running the government, if 100% of people are not working? Ok, so we assume the government workers aren't included in the ""100% living off UBI and not working"". But that just raises more issues: Who is paying the government worker's salaries? The government! That comes out of taxes, too.  The government needs to (for example) collect $1010 dollars from every person, so they can give $10 to the government workers, and the other $1000 ...right back to the people they just taxed it from?  So 'the people' end up $10 behind each cycle- they get taxed $1010, and get paid $1000.   Makes no sense.

Of course, those are the extremes. All other situations are a less extreme version of one or both of those cases.  Maybe only 50% of the workers stop working. This means companies will have to pay 2, 3, even 4 times as much to get workers. *And* their taxes go way up, too. Which means the price of their product goes up.  Which means the 'extra', 'free' UBI money just goes to paying off the higher prices of everything. And it means that UBI *by itself* is not enough to live on anymore, and will need to be raised- which means taxes need to go up to pay for it. It's a vicious circle.",against,against

"That's also true, yes - valuable addition to my comment.  Thanks!

One interesting thing is that a lot of the things we think about as ""empathic"" (social safety net, national healthcare, etc, etc) are actually *net productivity gains* for a country, too.

Amazingly (at least to most free-market conservatives) it turns out that if people aren't forced to choose between eating and paying rent that they're better able to concentrate on their jobs, and people not dying or becoming disabled due to preventable health problems are more productive than people who end up unable to work and become a net drain on the state , their family and community.

Trickle-down economics *also* empirically doesn't work, and tax breaks to the rich are a false economy, whereas studies seem to indicate that - again, counter-intuitively for a lot of people - even ludicrously utopian policies like a universal basic income work surprisingly well to increase overall productivity *and* happiness.

All those things also act to decrease inequality which promotes social engagement and a sense of civic responsibility, with all the good that that brings.

I mean I agree totally that we need to encourage empathy and basic human decency along with rationalism and basic logic in education... but the funny thing is that you don't always necessarily *have* to convince people of that stuff, because you can make a perfectly logical, efficiency-based argument for things like UBI all on its own.

Teaching people *how* to think should(!) be less controversial than teaching them *what* to think, so I was advocating the former because I think it would still achieve most/all of the benefits of the latter, rather than directly advocating the (more controversial) latter on its own, as if it was its own justification (which, sadly, many people would still disagree with).

\&gt; Primary wage earners worked a little less, but only slightly. Married women backed off too, but mostly to take longer maternity leaves. There was a drop in work by teenage boys, but Forget says many simply were able to stay in high school longer. Their families weren’t as desperate for another breadwinner.

"Except that generalized demand pull inflation hasn't been a problem since the 70s. Further, increasing the *baseline* minimum wage does not tend to cause a feedback loop of higher wage demands.

Back before globalization and technology explosions much of what we consumed was made right here in the US. So increases in demand directly drove demand for skilled workers in the US almost immediately. That demand for highly paid workers caused them to start demanding higher wages very quickly. More demand, higher wages, more demand, higher wages, etc.

That used to be very disruptive becuause the capacity to meet demand was limited and the result was inflation or too much money chasing too few goods. It was well understood and, in fact, it was so well understood that it persists as the common understanding of how things work.

Here's the problem, while you weren't looking the entire world globalized it's supply chains. Technology (automation, robots, CADCAM, etc) infused itself into almost every production process. That old relationship of ""more demand equals higher salaries"" got almost completely broken.

The US responded to this with retaining programs that have almost completely failed in most of the important ways. What actually happened is that more and more people were either pushed into ""not looking for work"" or ""disabled"" or into lower paying low skill service jobs where they are at the mercy of mostly oligopolistic actors. We've also seen the benefits of globalization and technological advancement accrue mostly to the top 1/10th of 1% of wage earners and capital owners.

The ""inflation"" that most people like to point to as proof that we have a problem is not like the old school inflation at all. Yes, housing is super expensive and getting more expensive all the time but that's *not* because people have more money to spend on housing. It's becuase people are taking on a larger and larger debt ratio to buy houses (ame with education). It's a problem but not a problem of higher wages chasing too few goods.

Really the economics that you (and a distressingly large number of people, including well educated people) think are basic and easily understood have not been true for at *least* 30 years, probably longer. The entire economic system shifted while you weren't looking.

An increased minimum wage, to the extent it has been implemented in the US, shows no signs of causing a cycle of inflationary pressure. Why? It's because a minimum wage does not change the fundamental structure of the economy. A retail worker bumped up to $15 an hour does not suddenly have the power to demand $16. In fact, if anything, that employer now has even more reason to outsource and use even more technology to eliminate positions.

Increasing minimum wage is a poor solution but not because of inflation fears. Andrew Yang's solution makes a lot more sense because a UBI does not have the effect of pushing *even more* jobs overseas or into the arms of a robot.",supportive,supportive
"Just to expand on the idea you mentioned

Think of farming. Agriculture used to be the main industry, driving force behind economies. But look at farming now. We farm better than ever, but we use not even a noticeable fraction of labor compared to before in pre-industrial days. 

Turns out a thousand dudes cutting wheat, 100 dudes to grind that into flour, and 10 dudes to bake bread is easily beat by a few machines. 

So those jobs simply went away into factories. And as we saw, factories moved away too, to cheaper places, to even better machines.

So those jobs then went into skilled labor and highly educated service jobs.

And as we are right now, the machines are again a problem. This time though, the machines can wipe out not only the menial factory jobs but the service jobs as well.

Now you're no longer completely safe if you're an accountant, engineer, pharmacist, even doctors. Once AI and big data are implemented into daily lives, a large portion of those jobs will simply be gone.

So unless you're going into some very highly educated jobs or learn a trade, there simply won't be jobs as most people know it to go around.

Universal jobs guarantee might sound good, like a public works agency similar to the WPA, BUT why employ a thousand dudes to build streets when, again, 1 machine and 2 smart guys suffice? Why employ 3 cashiers when 5 kiosks and 1 cashier work? Why employ 100 workers for a factory when the new machines can do it faster with only 10 workers? *Why employ 10000 accountants, when 1 very smart machine never makes a mistake and does things faster and cheaper?*

The idea behind UBI is, IMHO, 2 things: 

1. That now that we actually have a semblance of machines that can make things ""appear out of thin air"", why bother inefficiently working

2. The economic system as we know it needs jobs to drive consumption to drive production. We can overhaul the entire system into something Star Trek like, or we can patch the system for now by directly injecting income to consumers to replace lost jobs.

* Creating a universal basic income tied to GDP or some other metric (I'd love to see proposals for this).
* Reinvesting in America's infrastructure and education instead of nation building in 3rd world countries that actively act out against us.
* Prioritizing jobs for Americans instead of importing cheap labor via illegal immigration and H1-B visas (Hint: Savings aren't being passed down to consumers and no, I'm not racist).
* Ending unfair trade agreements and international cartels that give America the short end of the stick (TPP/NAFTA/OPEC). Globalization will happen, but stop trying to force it! Let it happen naturally as countries mature and economies develop organically.

"&gt;I never said that. 

Its your implication. Somone said ""1000's of peopel dont want to lose their jobs to robots"" and you replied with ""UBI"". The iplication being that people wont mind losing jobs becasue automation will bring about UBI. I am pointing out that no, it simply wouldnt. When we had our last great feat of automation we still forced places to hire people so as to not make so amny unemployed, and everyone else who fell through the cracks either retrained or you were fucked.

UBI is not coming, at least any time soon, while we live in such a hyper capitalist ""Every dollar counts"" mindset we have right now.

&gt; When UBI comes, the whole ""AI is taking jobs away"" thing will have a  whole different perspective, because it won't be necessary for people to  do those jobs to survive. 

We ALREADY live in this world. A lot of obs we don't need people for. Our solutions so far have ben to keep employing people anyway and just fire everyone else to make them get new jobs. No concrete signs of UBI coming to save their day.

&gt; Not being caught up in minimum wage jobs for years + free education  gives people the opportunity to gain higher levels of education and  consequently jobs, and better wages than they'd ever get nowadays.  

Thats all just a bit of a fantasy though. Higher education has been getting demonised AND more expensive over the years, not so much cheaper, especially if youre from the US/UK/parts of Europe. We have more peope in service based minimum wage job than ever before and still a growing population leading to even MORE of these jobs being needed to keep the poor happy.

&gt; While at the same time leading to more higher-level workers and therefore a much more efficient use of human resources. 

The humans need to want this though. We have offered retraining to people before and they have done everything they can to fight it. I have no idea about your time frame but I dont see AI taking everyones jobs and people being happy with it for a very very long time. ""They took our jobs"" has kind of been a thing for humans to rebel against ever since there were jobs to be taken.

"I am a socialist because capitalism dose not seem to solve the many crisis that are facing or going to be facing our planet.

1.) the crisis of climate change

capitalism offers no solution. market based solution are being slowly implemented to the point where we will all be dead before they have any real impact. also capitalist seem to be investing heavy into car's which are the most ineffective way to travel. cars hold a maxim of 5 people and a simple 2 land road takes up 12 ft of space form sidewalk to side walk.

also capitalism requires unlimited growth witch cannot happen because we live on a finite planet with limited resources.

socialist on the other hand knows that climate change is the greatest threat to our existence and would invest heavily in green energy and more efficient ways to travel like trains. trains can hold hundreds of people and a railway takes up 4.8 ft of space side to side. socialism is about real efficiency. efficiency under capitalism is the capitalist profits. if capitalist were about efficiency they would be investing in trains not trying to turn cars into robots.

2.) the crisis of hunger and the crisis of homelessness

again capitalism offers no solution in fact it might be the cause of the problem. in the USA we have more empty house than homeless people. why don't we house them all? because its not profitable. same thing with hunger we grow enough food to feed every man women and child on earth and still have leftovers. so why don't we? because its not profitable.

socialism on the other would have people feed because everyone's basic need would be covered. if you are hungry you get feed.

3.) the crisis of automation

30% of all jobs in 2030 will be automated. capitalism offers no solution to the unemployed. a UBI is just crumbs. I heard that giving people $1,000 a month would be good but I lived on $1,000 a month before and still relied on food stamps and food banks to eat. mean while the capitalist profit grows while the rest of the working class starves.

socialism on the other hand does away with the crisis of automation because when the workers own the factory they get the profits form the factory. so automation might even be encouraged under socialism because workers would have more time to spend with their family. so automation under socialism the worker loses his job but not his income.

There are 2 things here: 

1 - The people who are getting those checks generally are lazy by default, there's probably a reasoning why they're not high achievers. Government subsidies don't always lead to people being lazy, rather lazy people pick government subsidies 

2 - There is a window when getting off of state benefits where your actual income drops.

We -already- have free education. We've had free education since the late 1990s, its called the internet. The only difference between the free education you get online and a college education (outside of some very specialty fields) is the piece of paper you get. 

The benefit of college is not and has not been since the late 1990s knowledge (again, outside of some very specialty fields) but as a piece of paper to show you're better than the average person. 

What is there that you must learn, in person, at a college that you cannot learn with a low-cost laptop and a decent internet connection?

When they did speak out, it was against the NSA, not against Obama who was their boss. Backdoor snooping on GOP Presidential candidates by unmasking foreign wiretaps. Not a problem. 

* 9th and 10th Amendment - Nope. They can't stand to see states refusing to live under their designs. Nothing stops individual states from implementing Obamacare or single payer. Massachusetts implemented Romneycare. But that's not enough. They don't want to go that route. They have to force their maniacal utopian designs on everyone.

"Yeah you would, because she would not learn anything from it. She would learn that you will always catch her when she falls. That she would never have to grow up. 

Disclaimer: my parents are rich, but did give me fail money as a teenager. They let me make mistakes at 13-18 years old, not able to buy a wintercoat because all my clothing money went to expensive shoes ect. I just had deal with it (too small coat, summer coat with vest, not too hard a lessons but rememberable as a teenager). At 18 in my country I had to pay for my own cellphone and health insurance. The late payments were terrible, sometimes because I'd ignore envelops. And than I had to eat peanutbutter sandwiches for a month as a student (or raid my parents pantry).

If she isn't going to learn that you have only one money, and you have to have your priorities straight, than she'll fail as an adult. 

What will she do when you are dead? Eat out some more untill the money runs out? Or fly with a private helicopter to aan exclusive restaurant, I don't know how rich you are. But you can alllllways spend more than you have. 

There are whole families living on less than the budget she has as a single student in a month. Universal basic income in the USA would be a 1000 a month, she has double that. 

Just cut her allowence and everything if she fails uni because of this again. She needs some though love to become an independent adult. She needs to know what a waitress earns and how much energy it costs to do that job, before she can apriciate your gift to her.

The only practical advice I would give her, is that she has to have 1 account for the rent and phone and other basic stuff and 1 account for eating and going out and clothes. If she will fail that, she isn't ready for uni. Than she will have to learn a few other lessons. 

Money always comes with strings attached. She has to learn that. She has to learn which strings she'll prefer. Those of uni and your money/budget. Or that of a waitress/cassier/non-uni job. Or a dull/abusive/weird/old rich husband/sugardaddy 🤷",neutral,neutral

"First off r/NotOp

&gt; Yang has openly stated that the goal of his UBI is to get people off social safety programs, so that he can kill them.

I remember this was somewhere along those lines, but to say kill is some loaded language right there but I digress. The goal is to consolidate all government assistance into one single banner. The other options will exist for the time being and if we get to point where they aren’t needed anymore either due to UBI, a new president or whatever, then we won’t need them. They are simply ways to treat a problem Andrew Yang is attempting to solve.

&gt;Do you know how long it took to establish these programs? How long it would take to re-establish them if they were ever killed and UBI was subsequently dismantled?

That does worry me and I can agree that it’ll be scary to get them back if we need to but ideally they would not be dismantled until those programs aren’t needed anymore.

As for UBI being dismantled, that also seems unlikely. As Yang has stated himself, one State that has had a form of UBI for decades is Alaska, a deep red state and it’s been there for decades. If you try taking away people’s money then they are going to get mad. Politicians who advocate for taking away the Freedom Dividend after it has successfully been implemented aren’t going I be the most popular candidate afterwords.

&gt; Additionally, Yang's UBI is obviously much less comprehensive in what it can cover. Who in the world can survive from $1k/mo? Especially when considering those who are disabled? Very basic, monthly services for the disabled cost considerably more than what Yang is asking them to trade for.

That’s the thing though, this dividend isn’t meant for you to live on, it’s just a foundation that you can use to better yourself. With a portable 12k a year, you can do a lot of things including moving out to a new house, paying bills you couldn’t have otherwise, it’s enough to improve the lives of many Americans.

As for other programs, it’s not mandatory for Americans to take the Freedom Dividend, if they want to and feel as if their current benefits are working for them, then they can do that, it’s not necessary for them to take 1000 a month if they are getting something better. Many people don’t know this but the Dividend is opt in, not mandatory.

&gt; Not that he's going to be nominated, thankfully, but Yang would increase income inequality and exacerbate an already stratified and terrible healthcare system. It's bizarre to me that someone like you would support Yang over Sanders.

I can’t argue with something you publish no facts for but okay. Anyways even if Yang doesn’t get the nominee which I acknowledge is a reality, he still is a good candidate for brining up issues that no politician has really touched such as the 4th industrial revolution. 

Also I will be linking some of what Yang said to back me up later if you feel like it. Also this isn’t a criticism of Bernie but what do you say to those who worry he will die in office? To me that is one of the most important reasons as to why I’m not voting Bernie in 2020, at least not until I know who his VP is.",neutral,neutral
"Well you completely ignored how obviously a robot tax would still end up costing a business owner less than if they hired someone over the machine. Automation is still being encouraged, as it should. This tax would be used to fund the UBI, as well as a significant rollback on benefits (UBI replaces the need for them). This would also break down a lot of the bureaucracy associated with determining who is eligible for benefits, making the UBI much more efficient than the current system, thus saving the state a significant amount of money. 

&gt; A UBI won't solve employers concerns about taking on new employees for fear of large payouts for firing them. 

I won't disagree, but it would make sense that the introduction of a UBI would come with a decrease in the mandated payouts.  

Personally I would also think that UBI would create an environment which would encourage the creation of more cooperatives, something we here should all want to see, as all people now have enough time and resources to dedicate themselves in management and corporate decision-making as well as their day-to-day work. 

I also wouldn't necessarily disagree with that IMF report, but keep in mind that the IMF is inherently a liberal institution, and so would be happy to criticise France for its faults without ever showing the benefits of its way of doing things. Its fine to look at whats bad, but it needs to be a holistic approach. 

The minimum wage in France is in line with its real living wage, and thats how it should be. No one working a full week of work should have to live off any government benefits and/or poverty, as we see quite often in Britain. Besides, there are plenty of case studies that show that raising the minimum wage does not slow job growth, as while some business may hire less, the increased disposable income given to the people with the greatest propensity to consume means that businesses, especially small ones with are very important to the French economy, will grow, causing an increase in hiring.

"Hi after reading your article there are a few issues I'd point out:

* Your illustration with Amanda:  I have a feeling that you've never lived in a place (temporally or geographically) where $200 is a lot of money.  I understand you're providing a hypothetical, however for many it isn't.  An EXTRA $200 per month that Amanda gets to decide on how to spend may go towards having electricity, keeping her phone connected, having heat, better winter clothing for her children, or an extra curricular activity for her kids to (statistically) help them towards a better childhood outcome, areas the previous system didn't provide any assistance.  If Amanda is in fact living with numerous roommates that extra amount adds up rather quickly towards a better place to live.

* Regarding cost of living:  Yang has pointed out that if you try to adjust for this it will make administration costs skyrocket, which subtract the amount that ends up in hands of citizens, and also it opens it up to gaming though false reporting of residence and moving to a cheaper area inflating the cost again and likely reducing the amount to be distributed to other citizens.  Lastly if you account for regional cost of living you will distribute higher dollar amounts to citizens in economically healthy areas who don't need it, undermining the goal of raise up the disproportionately poor.

* Regarding people of other categories.  Yang has repeatedly stated that UBI isn't a replacement for work and it's not supposed to be enough to *""comfortably live on""* as you state.  If your artist has a fall back of 1k per month despite work income being irregular they can opt to save that 1k for when the months are skinny.  You assume that the 1k is all they'll have.  Perhaps for some that is the reality of their financial discipline, but to assume it true for all of these groups is just that, an assumption.

* Regarding your section on Negative Impacts of the VAT: Most of this section makes an incorrect initial assumption. Yang has already highlighted in his policy that staple items (basic food, diapers, etc) will have the consume exempt from the VAT.  It makes a secondary assumption that the end consumer will be responsible for shouldering these costs, which when you review the effects of market competition isn't true.  Businesses will do battle to get the best competitive to profit margin they can.

* Regarding the same section but on the required spending to be impacted by the VAT:  Those people are correct.  Again, the areas exempt from the VAT will dramatically derail your math.  Even if we did use your math, you say that $24k is a very easy number to spend.  Well again, that depends on where you're at.  While I live very comfortable I have lived below the poverty line and with no government assistance.  The annual **household** average income for my city is less than 40k.

* Regarding your section on housing:  The reality is not quite what you make it out to be here either.  Again, I live in a very poor city.  Personally my house payment is about $1,800/m for a home that is about 4k sqft.  I know many of the landlords in the area, while there are slumlords they can't keep their property occupied.  The typical here is about 500/m for about 550 sqft rental home with apartment rent being about 500.

* Additional regarding your housing sections:  You fail to realize there will be cross sector competition and that itself will effectively contribute to regulating prices.  Landlords can't suddenly jack up prices $200/m because food, clothing, heat, education, and other basic necessities are all competing for a portion of it.  A lot of your further arguments here are pure speculation and that's exhausting to try and catch someone's imagination as it flies across the sky.

* Should rent control be in Yang's policy?  Perhaps, but you go on for extended lengths to portray these as real worsening situations that you then allude to being solvable by simply applying rent control.  Yang's UBI and rent control are in now way incompatible even if every possible worst case scenario you've imagined out happens.  Also you fail to highlight any scenarios on the other side of outcomes which is either an oversight or dishonest, depending on your intent.

* Regarding the claim that Yang has no replacement policies for other assistance programs: Please go to [his site](https://www.yang2020.com/) and actually read ALL of his policies.

* Offering medicare for all without killing private insurance is still offering medicare for all.  You also provide no facts or sources behind the claim that Yang's M4A  will be too expensive or will be too expensive, an incredible set of options with zero substance, and then insist this will leave poor citizens worse off.

* Regarding middle class:  This is pure silliness.  The middle class are worried about retirement and savings.  They might not be living day to day, but they are not so well as to not have financial concerns.

* Regarding Alaska: They don't have UBI, they have a dividend.  Once a year.  For a few thousand.

* Regarding Bernie's policies:  Hiking minimum wage (taxed income) and offering guaranteed work will cause inflation.  Not everyone wants to work for the government and will these jobs be better than the lowest tiers of employment?  What will prevent future administrations from manipulating these jobs to manufacture voting?  How much government spending will be required to setup and administer those jobs?  Free college isn't a very good answer when work isn't waiting for graduating students already.

I respect Bernie for his work, passion, and honesty.  That said, there is no such thing as a perfect politician.  Nobody has the answers for everything and issues will persist.  You paint an entirely positive picture of Sanders as having solutions for a variety of issues you perceive with Yang's policies without detailing any of the costs of Sander's programs.

Personally I find the article to be mostly under-informed, highly prone to supposition, and equal parts a hit article targeting Yang and propaganda for Sanders.  You asked for my thoughts, there you go.

It's the most logical solution, and as UBI/related programs move into the window, this will too. The concepts, to some extent, go hand-in-hand. This may depend on you taking the optimistic ""UBI gives people freedom"" view or the cynical ""UBI will keep people from rioting"" view.

Yeah, this but it can't be much more. UBI is most powerful when it is to benefit the lower income classes.

Who it does give power to is families who make ~$12k. If I work at dollar general, and me and my coworkers are upset about making 10 hours per week, we can all walk out and still have UBI to protect us.

"That really depends on who you ask. Some people want to replace the welfare state outside of health and Education with UBI, others want to implement it over top of one.

The problem with this, is even with the existing welfare state being abolished, a UBI system would still be significantly more expensive than the existing welfare state.  

As I see it, basic income itself isn't the problem, it's actually a great idea, the problem is the cult of support that UBI has in contrast to it's more feasible and rational alternatives such as Friedman's Negative Income Tax (NIT). Going into the numbers the NIT makes a lot more sense straight off the bat since it provides for all citizens of working age under a specified income threshold and gradually rolls back funding for recipients as they make more money until the pass the threshold and become taxpayers themselves. This way it would easily be possible to provide $28,000 CAD to the poorest citizens of working age in the country and encourage the social mobility basic income promises, but without the ridiculous costs UBI comes with. Not to mention that a NIT would in all likelihood be less expensive than the current welfare state and actually drive government spending and tax levels down as a result. ",neutral,neutral

"I think it would depend on how it's implemented. Off the top of my head I can envision a scenario that wouldn't be all bad: Imagine an integrated UBI and carbon credit system.

Take a first world country as an example, say, the UK. A carbon credit system starts where everyone over 18 is allocated 20,000 carbon credits per year. There would be an open market for them and the price would be initially fixed at £1 per carbon credit.

The highest impact goods and services would have a carbon price attached as well as their normal money price. This would be set by an independent body including scientists and a council drawn from average people. The carbon cost of things like international flights, petrol, natural gas, high end electronics, red meat, etc would be set quite high. 

However the carbon credit cost of low impact commodities, goods, and consumables would be set low or at zero. Things like locally grown in season food, electric mountain bikes, solar panels and battery storage systems, warm natural fibre clothing, second hand goods and electronics, upcycled items etc. A basic low energy PC with internet access would be priced so low as to be almost free.

Someone who chooses to live a low impact low energy lifestyle in an insulated eco-pod or tiny passivhaus rarely travelling far and eating mostly vegan with some lower impact chicken or pork would end up spending almost none of their carbon credits each year. They can then be sold on the open market to those who want to buy them. A scaling mechanism could be built in to limit the maximum any one person can buy each year, even billionaires.

This would mean someone who takes steps to lower their own impact, both carbon and ecological, would not have to work at all, or perhaps choose to work part-time in whatever way they wanted, whether as an environmental activist, in regenerative agriculture, as an artist or writer or painter and so on, without the pressure to be 'financially successful or starve' in their work.

It would  be a way of incentivising degrowth but would require the entire system to have transparent oversight with safeguards against corruption or manipulation. It's not exactly the first world high energy and high consumption dream most are pushed by capitalism, consumerism, and advertising to want but I think many would welcome a system like this. Of course it is unlikely to be possible to practically implement it, or transition to it, from within our faltering societies, Perhaps once things have collapsed a bit more something like this could be tried.",neutral,neutral

"&gt;The main reason our government sucks so bad, is it basically only serves the wealthy. And to solve this you don't cut taxes on the wealthy.

Our govt also significantly helps the poor. Free school lunches, subsidized health care insurance via ACA, ebt, earned income and child tax credits, access to food banks, hefty federal grants for college, subsidized housing, etc etc. Again i fail to see how raising taxes on more affluent people is going to fix your problems because the laws and people running the show still hold power. 

&gt;WEll you know not providing individuals like myself with affordable healthcare, quality higher education, affordable housing and a safety net hurts individuals like myself. So we should have all these things, there's no excuse not to, we're the wealthiest country in the world right? And if that's our goal, tax cuts for billionaires accomplishes fuck all towards that goal, correct? 

And a lot of these problems with affordability is direcrly tied to govt incompetence from abused patent laws, FDA inefficiencies, student loan programs (college used to be $300 a semester for full time students), zoning regulations to protect home owners, etc etc. 

US didnt become a wealthy nation because of high taxes and huge welfare programs. They did so with sound money, cheap American labor, less regulations and destroyed world after WWII. 

&gt;This is a consumer driven economy. Your consumers having more purchasing power, improves the economy.

And thats our major issue here. We dont produce anything. Manufacturing is gone which were higher paying jobs compared to the health and food service industries that dominate today. 

&gt;I want working class Americans paying more taxes too...but I don't want to do it through raising their taxes, I want to do it through raising their incomes.

Id rather see peoples individual taxes decrease by lowering their taxes and giving more liberty for people to do what they want with it whether its to save, invest, donate or make purchases. Im not sure your idea of raising peoples incomes but imagine you want to use govt to force businesses to raise minimum wage. Doesnt matter. Your method will be ineffective. More people will lose their jobs because you created added expense to a business by at least $12,480 per full time persons. American businesses operate on low profit margins from 2-6%. Anyway US monetary policy constitutes 2% annual inflation so the value of their dollar will wane in the near future. 

&gt;You talk of faux concern about the problem with debt...well let's raise their taxes, they're now far wealthier than they were in 1980. Remember the tax cuts are suppose to pay for themselves, but so far that has proven to be a failure. 

Only high taxes i believe in are hefty inheritence taxes because its what separates a republic from aristocracy. By youre conflating individual income taxes with corporate taxes. Corporate tax rates would be best at 0%.

"Then you can bust your ass and achieve more than someone who lives off basic income.

" 

Conservative leadership hopeful Dominic Raab wants to cut your income tax. Should he win, the former Brexit secretary plans to [slash the basic income tax rate by five percentage points](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/05/21/philip-hammond-says-government-could-cut-taxes-working-families/) over a parliament, to just 15pc.

Being first out of the traps, Raab has set a baseline for scale and content against which rival candidates’ tax ideas will be compared. But there’s a much more pressing fix needed for income tax, and one that if done properly Conservatives would reap political benefits from: ending the creeping reach of Britain’s highest income tax rates.

During the coalition government, Conservatives celebrated taking poorer earners out of income tax with inflation-busting increases in the personal allowance. Yet this was part-financed by accelerating the trend for dragging more and more people into the higher 40pc and 45pc bands. That phenomenon has only been partially offset in recent years, following the Tories’ 2015 [promise to raise the 40pc threshold](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tax/income-tax/millions-save-100-year-chancellor-brings-forward-income-tax/) to £50,000.

Statistics on the stretching tentacles of the higher income tax rates are, as a result, quite incredible.

Back in 1990, just one in 15 income tax payers were in the 40pc bracket. It really did target the very top income earners. By 2009, the proportion had jumped to one in 10 – a near-doubling from 1.7m to 3.2m people. Now, after nine years of Conservative government, it’s higher than one in seven, with 4.7m people in either the 40pc or 45pc bands in 2018.

 

This was a policy choice from the Tories in government. The default for tax thresholds should be that they at least keep pace with inflation, and so preserve their real value. In the early years of the last parliament, the coalition government instead actually lowered the threshold for when the 40pc rate kicked in – causing the real value to plummet. Though there’s been real stability since then, the inflation-adjusted value of the threshold has fallen by 20pc since Labour’s last year in government.

Conservatives once lamented such “taxation by stealth”, but holding down the higher tax rate thresholds to produce “fiscal drag” has recently been their hidden tax of choice. [As wages and earnings rise via inflation or income growth](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/04/26/boom-time-pensioners-incomes-surge-workers-wages-struggle-beat/), not raising thresholds commensurately means more people paying higher average tax rates, raising revenues without government facing the scrutiny seen when directly upping rates. Whereas median pre-tax incomes in the UK rose by 21pc between 2009 and 2015, for example, the higher rate threshold actually fell by 2pc.

How many people talked about the tax increases on those affected?

The Tories since 2010 have therefore normalised us to stagnating higher tax thresholds, with politicians arbitrarily determining when they change. This is completely alien to many countries, especially the US, where tax band thresholds are index-linked by law.

 

Not adopting such measures simply undermines accountability for tax rises and creates a default for an-ever rising burden. Though few will lose sleep over it, the consequences further up the income scale are more severe. Gordon Brown introduced the tapered withdrawal of the personal allowance for those earning above £100,000, creating an effective 60pc marginal income tax band. More people have been dragged into that with the £100,000 threshold frozen and the expansion of the personal allowance widening the net over which this higher rate applies. The £150,000 starting point for the 45pc “additional” income tax rate has likewise been ossified since 2010. The number facing it has increased by 66pc in less than a decade.

A new Tory leader must end this stealth taxation and, at a minimum, renormalise protecting tax thresholds’ real values. Ideally that requires a retrospective jump in the higher rate threshold and new law to link thresholds to wages or prices.

Combined, such action would bring economic and political dividends for the party. The marginal tax rates many people face will fall, improving incentives to earn income. There would also be more cash in the pockets of many aspirational, conservative-minded voters too.

 

The opposition will wail about “tax cuts for the rich”, as they always do. In this case, though, the Tory party will be reaping a whirlwind of its own creation. By endorsing a baseline that only the personal allowance need ever rise, it is they who created a status quo bias that says increasing thresholds in line with inflation amounts to “a tax cut”.

That is totally wrong as a point of economics. Failure to raise income tax thresholds in line with inflation is actually a tax increase. Had such thresholds been protected in real terms since 2009, the 40pc rate wouldn’t kick in today until someone earned almost £58,000, and the 50pc rate until income earned £197,500.

Of course, reverting back to that would have big fiscal consequences. Raising the 40pc threshold to this level would reduce revenues by about £7bn per year.

But given that Raab’s basic rate cut proposal would forego somewhere around £25bn, it is worth using any tax-cutting space to offset at least some of the damage done.

More importantly, a future prime minister should legislate to create a new baseline and protect taxpayers going forward. US-style legislation that dictates that all income tax thresholds must rise in line with inflation or wages automatically would change default expectations. Politicians would have to vote to overturn the now expected increases in thresholds, with any votes to do so recorded and seen for the tax increases they affirm.

Such a practice could prove extraordinarily useful for taxpayers and Conservatives with the threat of a Jeremy Corbyn government on the horizon.",neutral,neutral

This would be similar to a basic pension.

I'm pretty sure most societies have universal basic income now.

Of course I don't have a clear picture on the details of a ""basic income"" system (I'm not sure if it's possible to tax people who don't work, or if you can even have universal basic income), but a basic income that would work in a socialist society would probably be something like a ""social wage"", where workers would be paid a wage, and all other benefits would be funded by workers' taxes.

Of course this would be only possible if people want to work. And of course there also needs to be a way for those who don't work to benefit from a basic income, so it's not a totally perfect system.

"The problem is that due to the economic shutdown, of which blame is shared by the previous and current administrations for different reasons, there is a dearth of production, and for a while that was acceptable because the demand for certain goods was lower, which helped stave off the inevitable inflation.  
Where the problem really begins is the massive stimulus bills that added 4 trillion dollars to an economy that was effectively stagnant (again, blame on both sides), and increasing the amount of fiat currency without increasing the supply of goods to match the inevitable demand that will erupt when restrictions are lifted.   
The scarcity on the supply side, combined with an increased demand, increased (if not unlimited) ability to add money, and people willing to pay higher prices for the same goods and producers able to charge more, will lead to frightening levels of inflation.    
Any rise in wages will not keep pace with inflation, and the currency will be devalued so the poor who work for slave wages now will effectively take a pay cut because their checks will not go as far. UBI isn't a solution either, as that means printing more money, devaluing the dollar even further.  
My predictive side says I can't wait for the MMT to kick in, and this administration decides the only way that they can manage the inflation is to raise taxes and suck money back out of the economy.

"I'm going to make a seperate post, and I understand how people might not see this related to UBI,

but an interesting thing about the ""boom"" over the last 4 years is that in the US $2T per year of wealth increase has come from stock market gains, and $1T per year from real estate equity gains.  This $3T in ""magical"" wealth gain is close to 20% of GDP.

As you know, this boom has left many people behind, but while innequality is a forefront social concern, the only real problem is that many are being left behind... not that some can get far ahead.

You can't rely on $3T annual magical asset growth every year, and the BS recovery of asset reinflation without any job growth is extraordinarily unprecedented.  If the $3T/year in wealth increase for roughly the top 1% breaks down, then the rest of economy will deteriorate further, and then more money printing programs (QE4) will be initiated to postpone the next crash.

The relationship to UBI is that nothing ever trickles down in this system, and it just creates an unsustainable path to collapse.

"Going on strike is basically quitting. ""If you don't meet X demands I won't go back to work"".

But it's also not my point. I'm not talking about bringing down the capitalist. Work is a necessary component of food production (until we can automate it), no matter what political system you put in place. So it's not JUST that the capitalist will starve, everyone will starve.

But even I see the violence inherent in even a minarchist system. If you charge a property tax to fund the most basic state functions, it means simply existing within that state means you must work, to fund basic national security, or we will throw you in prison. (assuming you have anti vagrancy laws.)

Although, there is one way to resolve this within a free-market framework. The cost of survival (and I mean not starving to death, not freezing to death, but die at 40 from an infected paper cut because you can't afford antibiotics survival) is $8250 a year per person. So make a UBI equivalent to $8250 per year. Some people argue that giving people these benefits for free would discourage work. IMO, most Americans already work much harder to do more than simply survive. So you could use the cohesion of the state to collect a property tax that funds ubi, security, and rule of law. And the simple motivation to do more than live like an animal in a zoo would motivate enough people to work hard to fund security, the basic survival needs of everyone, and grow the economy. And anyone who stops working probably wasn't being that productive anyway.

(A study by the military found that only 10% of pilots accounted for 90% of kills in WWII dog fights and that in Vietnam drafted soldiers were counterproductive. Hence the volunteer only military. I suspect that a ""volunteer only"" workforce might be more efficient, assuming some number of otherwise criminals just live on UBI. We would pay for their survival anyway, this way you save on prison security.)

And it is being proposed to keep wages down for those in work. Any decent level of basic income would be just too costly for capitalism to afford.

How is that not out of touch? Who would that help? I certainly wasn’t expecting to be included in a UBI program but I don’t see how that amount can help anyone in this city. And the fact that he just doesn’t have the experience!! He’s said he’d love to hire Garcia if he wins, like wtf so he’s saying she’s more competent than him (which she probably is since she has actual relevant experience in city government).

Other than him making the idea of UBI a popular topic, I don’t see what else he brings to the table. And looking through his plans for implementing his ideas, it falls short. How does he plan to do these things? A lot of his answers are vague “we will work with XX agency to make this happen” “we will set up a committee to do this” “we will demand Albany gives us more seats at the table for managing MTA budget” — and what happens when Albany or these other departments don’t want to play ball? The mayor needs to be a good project manager, have established relationships with people already government and just a basic understanding of HOW things get done, not just wishful thinking.

Every single one of these has been discussed ad nauseam and are able to be dealt with in the context of freed market capitalism. Too many books, videos, and articles out there for me to make a suggestion, if I find anything I think is particularly good I'll add. 

&gt;Not to mention: even the small legal tussles I've had to go through from various business dealings or even just with scummy landlords have been horribly taxing and expensive in both dollars and emotions.

Our current legal system is shit. 

&gt;I am just not satisfied with the property rights answer.

Which is fine, but that doesn't mean it is not the best option (at least as a foundation). Keep in mind you don't get to compare optimal theory to gritty reality, so we either compare IRL Capitalist outcomes to IRL Socialist/communist ones or we compare theories. 

For example; climate change is fairly easy to solve, at least the bulk of it is. 

* Combine liquid thorium power with a full court press to perfect next gen geothermal 
* Shift our farm bill to subsidizing regenerative ag
* Add a realistic carbon tax

About the only thing that doesn't fix is emissions from plans &amp; vehicles, however with cheap enough energy we can use atmospheric carbon to create fuel, leading to carbon neutral fuels. Government policy is the only thing standing in the way of this currently. 

&gt;In other words, you use economic planning, but only in the sense that you can set an additional price on top of some good based on how damaging its production process is.

The whole process you described is just a really complicated way of creating a pigouvian tax. You may think this system is better over all but in terms of dealing with externalities it is just a pigouvian tax. 

&gt;I guess because we've been trying to improve the system for decades and it has been fruitless.

Fruitless...? 

Your assumption is that we are dealing with more externalities now than we were in 1950? Virtually every measure has improved (especially in per capita terms). 

&gt;We're in a real pickle now, because climate change mitigation was blocked actively by politicians and their corporate puppetmasters for so long that we can really only get out with drastic change.

I watched an Inconvenient Truth when it was in theaters, I have been following this for a long time. Realistic alternatives, such as nuclear power, have been blocked by those yelling about climate change the loudest. 

&gt;What we should have been doing, as public awareness of climate change rose, is gradually increasing the prices of fossil fuels over a 15-20 year period to ween off their usage, possibly with some kind of negative income tax/UBI to cover the rising costs while the transition happened.

This would have been net zero and little to no change would have happened. The problem is that most of the alternatives deemed 'acceptable' make us all worse off. We would literally be better off focusing on economic growth and outcome mitigation than going that route. 

But we are getting off on a tangent here... 

&gt;If the outcomes were the same, I probably wouldn't care about socialism as much. I do agree with some of the critique of exploitation and property and all that (maybe not enough to warrant some huge upheaval), but there are other parts of capitalism that really get to me regardless... 

If my claim about fixing capitalism being the better risk adjusted ROI, assuming the eventual outcomes are the same is true, then Socialism would have to be significantly better to justify pursuing that option. 

And remember we are not comparing theoretically optimum socialism to our current fucked up form of capitalism but comparing an economically &amp; historically grounded theory of socialism to the same type of theory of fixing capitalism.

And no one will question it or call it price gouging. 

It happens around military installations all the time, the housing allowance is supposed to reflect what the cost of living *is* (rent, rental insurance, &amp; utilities), but every time the housing allowance is adjusted upward, the leech landlords watch for the rate increases and adjust their rent cost accordingly. So the housing allowance stays at a place that barely covers the cost of rent alone. ",against,against

If there was ever a time to trial a Universal Basic Income, isn't it now, even just for 12 months?

We need support for hospitality and service businesses (eg physios, dentists, hairdressers, gyms etc) - they rely on in-person clientele so have suffered more from lockdown restrictions than most and didn't get any special assistance. 

We need more community focused living being built - didn't a whole lot of people feel isolated during lockdown? Why not build all the new houses people keep talking about in more community-focused ways - perhaps some Co-Housing? Why make houses all face away from each other with fenced off back yards and no common recreation area / lawn etc? Wouldn't fostering better neighbourhood connections benefit most people?

"&gt; But is there a moral obligation to society if society has given provision?

I see the question now. That's debatable. If society *needs* something, then yes. But if, as technology eliminates more and more jobs, particularly the low-skill jobs, I think that the answer becomes ""no."" We could, for example, require people to spend eight hours a day digging holes, and filling them back up, in order to receive access to the basic government facilities, or however we do it. But why should we? Why not let them do what would make them happy? They might wind up making beautiful art, or producing some nifty technological advance, or something. They also might produce nothing at all. But if there's no need, why should we produce artificial need?

Additionally, I feel that people should be given the ability to actually decide for themselves to work or not. Currently, people don't really have that choice. You work so you can eat. If people could choose to not work, places like wal-mart would have to offer decent wages, decent working conditions, and treat their people with some measure of courtesy.

&gt; Work isn’t “hurting yourself” or am I misunderstanding you?

No, that was me answering the wrong question. *I* misunderstood *you.*

&gt; Being the corpse for society to leech off of is not a mutual beneficial relationship. It doesn’t actually matter if they have enough to provide for everyone or not.

A strange way to phrase it, particularly given that I laid out their benefit. They don't get rich by magic; they get rich through other people. People work in their factories, or sell their products, or operate the businesses they invest in. They get rich *because* of the people under them.

&gt; Their decision to leave or not will be based on their assessment on a benefit/cost analysis of going somewhere else. If another country offers them a zero percent tax rate, they’ll certainly consider it.

This reads to me as ""if there is another place where they can continue to benefit from the working class, without having to provide benefit in return, they will consider it.""

Am I misunderstanding?

This is, to me, the entire point. Rich people get rich off the blood, sweat and tears of the laborers, and the laborers want to leach money back out of the corpse of rich people.

Or, to put it less antagonistically, rich people get rich by the actions of the working class. The working class wants to be supported by the wealth of the rich people. Mutual benefit.

&gt; it’s slow, but it’s a start and something that other countries with less economic freedom can’t provide.

This is true, and it is certainly a *good* thing, but it's not really an answer to the objection that people can get rich by way of already being rich.

&gt; Good luck with your company, seriously, but it doesn’t sound like you would be at all thankful for their investment. Enough failures in a row and they lose more than the boat.

Oh, I'd be *thrilled* for their investment. I'd be more thrilled if I had some sort of UBI, so that I could focus more on my work, and less on figuring out how to pay my bills. I could go get a ""normal"" job, of course, but if this works, (and we're *SO CLOSE*) it will be a huge benefit to a lot of companies, and a sweet return for our investors.

"So hey. I never respond to anything but I just listened to this and I really felt the need to respond to it. I hope I don't regret this.

First, my background: I agree with basically every left policy. Healthcare, taxes, foreign policy, reproductive rights, gun control, election reform, basically everything. I'm even for UBI. Not so much on abolishing ICE, because I'm a centrist, but I'd be down for some major reforms and I am certainly for more open borders. I voted for Obama in 2012, and I was in favor of Bernie in 2016. I was mistrustful of Clinton (and the DNC) and thought Trump was an idiot with no scruples, so I voted 3rd party as a protest vote.

What I want to say is mostly about your section discussing the WP article. To start, you were entirely right about the article. Their concerns about focusing the narrative don't really mater at this point, the candidates are well tailored to their districts and honestly anyone who is still in the party is going to see abolish ICE as ""reform our border control"" not ""Wooooooo No Borders!!!"".

At least I think they will. I don't actually know because I don't really feel like I'm still in the party. And that *is* because of the outrage. Because the left keeps eating itself. Anybody remember how the women's march rejected the women who were anti-Trump but pro-life? What about that guy who wrote the google manifesto? You guys remember that alt-right Intellectual Dark Web meme from like a year ago? Turns out the people in the IDW are nearly all center-left. What about the #walkaway thing? It's probably just a bunch of alt-right bots trolling right? But I'm actually left on like all the policies and I agree with just about everything in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pjs7uoOkag) that started it.

Outrage will be an obstacle in the midterms. Not because of policy on the left, or the candidates on the left, or really anything to do with the democratic party, but because there is a large minority of people who lean left who feel attacked or at best ignored by the left.

Now, despite everything I just said, I am probably still going to be voting democratic. Only because I disagree on literally every issue with the republicans (and I'd like to point out that we should be better than the lesser of two evils).

"I'm happy to.

First, Yang's plan assumes that the only reason poor people don't get jobs is because they are incentivized by welfare programs. That's a right wing talking point that is demonstrably not true.

Second, yes, giving $1000 to a poor person and taking $100 back is effectively the same as giving him $900. But this plan still favors those with the most because they do not spend the same percentage of their wealth. This plan will lead to those with disposable income hoarding wealth instead of spending it. As noted, it will hit every step of the transactional chain, which will cripple small business and lead to fewer jobs as well as higher prices. No one is going to stay in business to lose money. That just doesn't happen.

Third, it takes away current assistance programs which will again effectively tax the poor for being poor. Yes, $900 is more than $750 (please note that the article conveniently forgets to take out that 10% VAT the poor must pay), but that means a net benefit of $150 instead of $900. That's $150 more, but it's certainly not the the windfall Yang and his apologists would like you to believe.

Fourth, Yang's plan doesn't account for current state and local sales tax in the US, which can range from nothing up past 10%. This means some areas would have effective sales/VAT tax rates of up to 20%! That exceeds the highest sales/VAT rate in Canada by 5%!

Fifth, this plan WILL lead to inflation. There is no way to place a 10% tax on every part of the transactional chain for businesses without causing higher prices. It's simply impossible. And the worst part of this is that luxury goods have higher profit margins than non luxury items, so the cost of a yacht might not go up very much, but the price of your clothing probably will.

Sixth, adding such a high tax on goods and services will cause those with the most means to look elsewhere in purchasing high cost products. Will Yang also push for tariffs on Canada and Mexico where the cost of buying a new car or yacht will be less than the US with the new VAT/sales tax? Is so, we're talking about another Trumpian tariff war.

Seventh, the arguments made for this plan are the same as used for trickle down economics and even use much of the same language, including saying that it doesn't matter what the wealthy get so long as others get it as well. We already give far too much to the wealthy and this plan does little to effectively change that.

Eighth, Yang's UBI gives $900 to every person over the age of 18 and nothing at all to children. Do children not eat or need clothing? Why does Yang's plan punish those with kids? Again, this plan harms those with the most need while rewarding those who can subvert the system.

Ninth, I think we can all agree that the cost of living is higher in urban centers than rural areas, yet Yang's plan makes no allowance for this at all.  $1000 isn't going to do much for a poor person in NYC compared with South Bend, IN.  Especially when that person in NY has to give up welfare benefits to receive that $1000.

So yes, the VAT is extremely regressive no matter how Yang tries to dress it up. It will have very limited benefit for those in need and allow those with the most to slip by the worst of the cost increases.

VAT tied to UBI, as Yang proposes, is a scam being fed to those who want free cash but can't be bothered to read the fine print.",against,against

GDP can go in many directions, depending on many factors. Heres a simple gauge -

2) GDP doesnt do anything - UBI is poorly designed and has very little impact, maybe increasing citizen welfare by a few 1000 Rs in the most vulnerable categories.

The 80B was from 0.1% of 80T in transactions as reported from payments Canada and candeal.  Ubi works proposal is 0.2 of that which would be 160B, 6% of our GDP.

The proposal of a UBI is essentially to bring about more financial freedom to the average person and allow them to participate more in free market capitalism. 

You saying you would bake in cost, that's fine in the beginning. However you will be creating an opening for competition and the more people that are in a financial position to take that risk will. 

I don't know what the average person does in electronic financial transactions per month but let's call the total 10k. That would represent a cost of $20 to them. I think I am estimating on the high end but let's say I'm not and double it to 20k. A cost of about 40$ to that individual. 

The idea that the regular person would choose to not financially benefit themselves instead of major corporations banks and other financial institutions is wild to put it lightly. Which brings me back to the point of being the issue that should be run on.

&gt;&gt;I don't think it's practical the way Yang proposed it

These two points seem to contradict each other because the UBI that Yang proposed explicitly handled that concern. Yang even mentioned that UBI isn't a new idea, but that it fails in countries where it's set to a high enough level that you don't need to work. Things go downhill when everyone is solely living off of UBI.

Thus why he set it at $1,000--which puts average Americans right under the *poverty* bracket. Meaning they can scrounge by on it if they're in a bad place, but they essentially still need to work to make a comfortable amount to thrive on and actually break out of the poverty line. Which is of course important because like you mentioned most people need work to satisfy fulfillment.

So I guess I'm just curious why you thought his approach wasn't practical? I can't imagine a better way of implementing it other than having that goldilocks sweet spot.

"I think that it's fallacious to characterize struggles for positive economic and political reforms as fights that are explicitly against capital. One of the strengths of bourgeois liberal-democracy is its ability to mediate between the interests of national-capital and of the working-class, striking a compromise that satisfies both the need for capital, on the one hand, to continue to expand and, on the other, the literal survival of the working-class. 

Marx writes that the value of labour-power is the equivalent of the value of the commodities requisite to reproduce it — i.e., to ensure the worker's survival and continued ability to work another day. Capital definitely has a vested interest in ensuring the survival of its workforce. And more and more we're seeing companies like Walmart, who fail to pay their employees a living wage, relying on the existence of government welfare to ensure their workforce's survival. The burden is shifted to the state. 

edit: This phenomenon is, I think, the explanation for why so many capitalists support the institution of a universal basic income — in their quest to maximize profits, the burden to ensure their employee's continued ability to labour is no longer their responsibility.

"A shorter summary of what I’m trying to say is I think monetary policy can be tied to all of these:

- Business cycle (more info here -&gt; https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=trHlLzKWZ3Q)
- Selecting an incompetent expert class (an expert class will emerge regardless, my point is they’d have less control over the economy if they weren’t able to manipulate monetary policy, and revenue outside of federal manipulation would be a better means of distributive selection)
- Favoring short term over long term investment (stimulating the production of useless chatckies in the short term so that people stay employed is an explicit goal of Keynesian economics)

An even shorter summary is I think messing with monetary policy distorts economic signals that messes up everyone’s decision making.

No one is barring anyone from labor by not artificially stimulating the creation of useless jobs, if people remain unemployed in an economy without artificial stimulation thats an argument for UBI and/or making it easier to make a life for people without full employment. There’s an argument more leisure time will result in many more new creative business ventures and more productivity overall, and in a more useful way then stimulating the creation of more hamster wheels.

If you disagree, then agree to disagree, thats fine. Just want to clarify my point, I’m not dictating what people should value. I’m saying federal manipulation of monetary policy distorts what people value and artificially rewards more short term thinking than would otherwise be the case.

Before lords, kings, rulers and state systems humans had a lot of infighting until we realized that tribal support systems, village communes and leaning on each other for our needs lead to better survival outcomes. We lived this was for roughly 190,000 years. Then states were formed and they convinced us that we should organize into class systems where few have a lot and majority have a little. Modern states only go back to about the year 1640. NO HUMAN deserves precarity. The Central Bank can create currency from nothing. WE NEED A UBI. Nothing less will ease the suffering of the masses.

It's an easy thing for anyone to say, ""You should have several months of savings to fall back on"", but much harder to do when you work a shit job for shit pay.  With a UBI, at least we wouldn't be leaving those people completely destitute.

It's a slippery slope argument to go, ""If we give them this now, they're just gonna want more and more"".  And...yeah.  That's true.  Give people something for nothing, and there'll always be that fear that more and more taxation will be poured into the welfare class.  That's totally understandable.

When I see that it's cheaper to give a homeless person a place to live than their cost to the medical and support systems that are already government funded, I do feel there's an argument to be made for it, though.  Especially since welfare actively disincentives finding a job; they make less working than just staying home.

But that's where I'd put the UBI; government housing, bare bones amenities, enough to live off of, absolutely nothing for luxuries; not even a cable subscription.  Anything beyond that requires working for it.  Make it a progressive weaning, so that regardless of how much you get paid, you make more actually working than not.

"Well, because she most closely fits what I would want/what I expect in a president.

There's a lot of talk constantly about how ""polished"" she is, how prepped, how much she lacks genuine enthusiasm and everything she says is poll tested before she speaks - and to be quite honest I dont really give a shit about any of that.

First of all, I've actually met/spoken with the woman in person, albeit breifly. But even in a couple short minutes it was easy to see how charismatic she is in smaller more intimate settings where she can speak more freely vs. large staged rallies or TV interviews. 

The one thing that really stuck in my mind was just how intelligent she was. And anyone who really were to sit down and analyze in-depth her speeches or discussions (outside of soundbite factories like stump speeches, debates, or TV interviews) can plainly see that she has command over a staggering amount of knowledge. Shes one of those people whos mind is so many steps ahead that she's probably already gone over and recited the whole conversation in her head before it's finished unfolding. Which honestly is what you should probably expect from someone who has a JD from Yale, and has been both a Senator and Secretary of State.

There's a lot of consternation over how she has a penchant to say dumb shit sometimes, but I honestly believe that moments like that are just run of the mill political pandering. No one wants to hear her elucidate for 30 minutes about her fiscal and tax policy, they just want to hear a nice soundbite and move on. Her problem, more than anything, is that it's moments like that where she lacks the spontaneous charisma of politicians like Obama or her husband, so she ends up trying to sound more ""down to earth"", but usually just ends up sounding contrived. But again, I see this just more of her being bad at that specific type of pandering that all politians must do vs. her actually being a robot and/or idiot.

I also admire her pragmatic approach to many things. I am as solidly liberal as they come - I'm in favor of single-payer healthcare, an increased minimum wage, a negative income tax or universal basic income, etc., etc., but I know that ideas like that just wont work in the real world. And by not work I don't mean not actually impossible to function/work, I mean that with the political climate in America they are just not currently possible to get past the electorate. And no matter how much I dislike the Right and most of what they stand for, they still account for nearly half of this country, and as such must be engaged and compromised with. To ignore them completely (when they're not doing blatently unconstitutional and/or discriminatory things of course) and unilaterally push my agenda over theirs, believing myself to be morally right and them in the wrong, makes me absolutely no different from conservatives/Republicans who would do the same to me. 

I'm one of those people who is more than willing to accept giving up 50% of what I want to get 50% of what I want. Unfortunately, people like me seem to be in the minority these days. You either believe in raising the minimum wage or you're pro-poverty. You believe in breaking up big banks or you're a corporatist.

"That's called Social Democracy, and the answer is no.


1. It doesn't attempt to solve the destructive contradictions between worker and boss that sees a constant social and economic tension between exploited workers and morally corrupted owners who NECESSARILY seek to reduce the expenses of labor through automation, cutting wages, etc, due to reason number 2:

2. It doesn't transcend the profit motive of permanent, unsustainable expansion and acceleration of capital that gobbles up the entire world and squeezes all the blood from every stone to get as much from every market as possible. People often mistake this for greed, no, the entire system is predicated on money creating more money because that's what investment is, which means you HAVE to find that money somewhere. That means cutting benefits, hiring immigrant labor, outsourcing to Bangladesh, abusing modern slave plantations to mine or harvest raw materials, and of course destroying the environment which is no problem for the Capitalist because he lives in a Manhattan highrise, disassociated from his workers and their environment. This is hard coded into Capitalism, there is no way around this, there is no compromise. When I say morally corrupted; this is what I mean, it FORCES the people who run these enterprises to think like monsters against the interests of their workers and consumers because they need to squeeze them for all they're worth.

3. It doesn't abolish the corrosive influence of those special interests over politics, meaning they'll just find their way back in and reverse all the progress that was made against them over time. This isn't theoretical, this is WHY we're here RIGHT NOW, FDR style New Deal Social Democracy was slowly devoured and eroded by neoliberal Milton Friedman inspired Capitalism until Reagan and Thatcher eventually sold the world over to it wholesale and everything we're living in is directly a consequence of trickle down looting of the working class by Capitalists. This is referred to as both revanchism, the ruling class reversing territorial losses incurred after a social movement, and regulatory capture, the ruling class Capitalists exerting their tremendous influence over the political system in ways we're all familiar with by now. They also own all the media so they can brainwash the public to buy into their material political interests (i.e. anti-union, anti-taxes, """"""small government"""""", culture war politics) at their pleasure.

3. Social Democracy is a domestic policy that seeks to square the circle of improving our material lifestyles while also eliminating the grossly immoral aspects of Capitalism such as income inequality and corporate corruption. But this is a selfish, chauvinistic non-solution because those lifestyles would still be built on the slavery and exploitation of third-world labor and resource extraction colonies. Equality isn't equality if the only goal is to make sure everyone at home gets to share the same amount of treats you all stole from some poor brown people in South America. 

4. It has NO answer for the coming apocalypse of automation and wage labor abolishing itself as more and more and more low-skill jobs are erased from the economy and high-skill jobs are converted to low-skill jobs that the entire reserve army of labor is now competing for, leading to a feudal gig economy where everybody is an uber driver with no benefits. UBI is obviously not the final solution to this; nobody wants to live according to an arbitrary *allowance* given to them by a government which has now been COMPLETELY co-opted by financial interests because the working class doesn't even have the power to meaningfully strike anymore. A UBI is a good bandaid, but we cannot afford to stop there.

5. It preserves the injustices and exploitation of private property (not personal property) and totally fails to solve problems like homelessness [which can and have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVuCZMLeWko) been easily solved in the past by just... rerouting the housing industry to focus on human need instead of building more luxury apartments for the rich because that makes more money for land developers and real estate investors. Who may or may not be in the fucking government dictating policy ABOUT housing and real estate. 

6. On a more philosophical point, the effect of consumer culture on society is often not seen but very much felt. Historical  sites in Mecca have been bulldozed to build Popeye's chicken, turning the enormously important cultural site into a theme park that uses the magnitude of the religion as just another advertising strategy. The pyramids of [Giza are surrounded with b r a n d s.](https://i.redd.it/0gxpou2q20hz.jpg) Incredibly meaningful social and civil rights movements like BLM are captured, sanded down, and repackaged by b r a n d s as another frontier to trick people into buying their shit. It debases and co-opts and destroys everything sentimentally meaningful to humanity and enslaves it to the profit motive. Capitalism destroys human spirituality because the only thing that actually matters is money, and nothing is allowed to exist outside of it. Everything sacred will be profaned. A spiritual connection to each other and some larger understanding of ourselves is impossible in a world where literally everything is a market. Like monasteries pimping themselves out for tourism bucks to stay open.

It doesn't solve the inherent injustice of underpaying certain industries like teaching or animal work or, I don't know, staying home and raising children which rewards you with ZERO dollars, just because it's not as profitable as hitting a ball with a stick really really well, it doesn't attempt to challenge the hierarchies of Capitalism that rewards the most morally corrupted sociopathic exploiters like fucking Trump with fabulous wealth and power, it remains fundamentally undemocratic because all the major economic decisions are made by an ever shrinking class of corporate dictators who, as I said, also unilaterally own the networks of information such as TV stations and news magazines.

That's the most backwards, racist fucking thinking on the planet. If African American communities continue to blame ""white America"" for all of their problems, they will never fucking be fixed.

Yes, people are still racist. Both white *and* black people... and asian, and hispanic, and european. Even the fucking swedes, the liberal wet dream of a country, are fucking racist. It's a fact of human culture that most people don't like people different than them.

School segregation does not exist today; it is illegal to do anything against a person's race, religion, or gender. The ""segregation"" is done by socioeconomic factors; middle class families move to the suburbs for the better school districts. That leaves poor people in schools. It's not white people moving away from black people, it's rich people moving away from poor people.

There are deep fucking cultural problems with poor communities that make the middle class want nothing to do with them. Drug problems. Coping mechanisms. Violence. Crime. Theft. These are not only committed by black people, but they are by and large mostly committed by poor people. Try taking a new iPhone to the school in the OP and see what happens.

Like the other commenter mentioned, only 1 kid's parent out of 70 kids came to the parent teacher conference. Surely some of them couldn't make it; maybe they're out working multiple jobs. But all but 1 of them? There's something profoundly wrong with these kids' home lives.

It's fucking hard to work out of poverty; white or black. (It's easier when you're orange and get a ""small loan"" of a million dollars.) Raising the minimum wage does not make it easier to do so. It makes finding jobs at minimum wage harder. What we'd need would be a universal basic income to allow people to survive while working on better skills.

You don't become a more valuable human being mopping floors for a living. You don't become more valuable working at McDonalds. No person should see that as a career. These jobs will not be jobs for long. Automation will replace these people, and if you as a human do not work to make yourself more valuable than a robot, what the fuck good are you?

Poor people are too busy working to survive to be able to work to improve. That 9th grader should not have ""a lot of responsibilities at home"". Kids shouldn't be so scared of what other kids will do that they can't focus on learning at school. That's not white people holding the black kids back, that's the other fucking black kids and their shitty parents keeping the entire community back.

&gt;Demilitarize the police?

 When people are looting and rioting in the streets, fuck no. The police have the responsibility to keep the fucking peace. How about people stop the violent protests?

That's not white people; that's fucking colleges acting like businesses instead of institutions of learning. We need public university reform. Colleges should be strictly available to people based on their academic merits, and not who will bring in the most money to the school.

"Not looking into the cost or specifics of who benefits or loses.

The dole is a welfare system in which job seekers fulfill ""mutual obligation requirements"" in order to receive the benefit. In terms of welfare policy goes, this is very standard in which a disadvantaged party first has to meet criteria before receiving a benefit. The current welfare systems also fall into the trap of disincentiving receivers to get off the benefit. As mentioned above, many see the additional income to not be worth the additional effort required of having a job.

Universal Basic Income differs from the standard where theoretically all individuals receive the benefit without means testing or work requirements. In theory, universal policies are considered more efficient due to less administration costs. It also removes the disincentive as unemployed do not stop receiving the benefit once they find employment.

0 program cuts and $30B ""cost"" is a net 0 tax cut.  (Canadians pay and receive $30B overall.  Taxes are more progressive though.)

$100B program cuts with $300B ""cost"" is $100B tax cut, and enough to eliminate poverty.  90%+ of Canadians would see a tax cut.

Part of the idea of UBI is getting rid of waste from support programs like SNAP that spend a bunch of money and resources deciding who should get the benefit.  If everybody gets it, you don't need a huge organization of people administering the program.  That does not mean you get rid of the social safety net, it means you get rid of unnecessary overhead whenever UBI makes that possible.",neutral,neutral
"&gt;UBI doesn't need to be fund with taxes on middle class incomes. For example it can be funded by taxes on interest, dividends, capital gains, intellectual property, or by simply by fiat money creation (the same way all money is created now; we haven't had a resource backed currency in decades).

You'll need to show the math because there isn't enough capital gains to pay for it.  As for printing money, sure that would work....

&gt;That aside, the reason we need UBI for social stability is that automation is increasing removing the opportunity to get a lower class or middle class income from employment.

A method I like that isnt technically a ubi is a lump sum payment, preferably when ones about to enter the workforce or become a legal adult, whatever age that is determined to be. Since such a small portion of the population turns any one given age every year, its an easily affordable system that gives money to every citizen at a crucial point in their life. For example everyone would get $50,000 upon turning x age, if you compare that to ubi where you are funding people each year upon hitting adulthood for the rest of their life, you can see the burden on society to meet such payments is much greater and the overall cost is much higher per person. For instance, lets say ubi is $10,000, so 10,000 per year from 20 years old to 80 years old is $600,000 - compared to say a lump sum of 50,000 (or take your pick the amount) when turning 20. u/tissueboxesoffun",neutral,neutral

"&gt;What does a CEO do that is worth millions per year

We make things happen. ""Things happening"" &gt; ""things not happening.""

If you don't believe me, go start a company, turn it into a huge success and collect those millions of dollar per year yourself. Not so simple, is it?

You may as well complain about your brain. It consumes a quarter of the calories used by your body. And it doesn't do any of the the breathing or blood pumping or heavy lifting that the rest of your body does. Clearly, the brain is bloated and unnecessary, and its high caloric consumption isn't justified. Clearly we should cut it out and only give it as many calories as an equal weight of muscle tissue consumes, and cheer success for the proletariat! Oh wait, that would be a terrible idea.

&gt;the vast majority of that $18M paid to the CEO is sitting in an account somewhere earning interest.

Where it is used by fund managers to issue loans to people and companies, to fund real estate deals that wouldn't happen without that money, etc. It's not like it's in a pile under our bed. 


&gt;Right now, the poor can't afford basic needs. 

And THAT is the problem here. Not that the rich are rich. It is *vastly more productive* to look at people with needs and ask ourselves how we can fill those needs than it is to look at people who have more and ask how we can take it away from them.

&gt;CEO takes compensation of $18.7M in 2010, 1200 times the annual wage of the average associate. How is that ok? Does he contribute 1200 times the value as an associate?

If the company is successful because that guy is in charge collecting that money, then *yes* he's worth every penny.

Let me ask you a simple question: if somebody is paid a million dollars per year, *why* is he getting that much? His salary is not created out of thin air. It comes from somewhere. If somebody *receives* a million dollars, that means that somebody else *has* a million dollars to give him, and apparently believes that giving him that million dollars is a worthwhile use of the money. *Why* would they think that? The money doesn't appear about of nowhere. Somebody who *has* the million dollars thinks he's worth that much and is willing to give it to him. Why? Why doesn't McDonald's grab a cashier and put him in the CEO chair and pay him $7/hr? Why don't they promote some middle manager and pay him $50k instead of a million?

Do you think maybe there's a *reason*?

What is that reason?


&gt;raise the pay of its workforce to a reasonable living wage

See, part of the problem is that you and most of the rest of the lower classes perceive yourselves as being in a dependent relationship with someone you perceive as taking advantage of you. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong...but that's really how you see it, right? But if that were really the case, then the obvious thing to do would be to simply cut off that relationship. If a woman is being beaten by her husband, what advice would you give her? Leave him, right? And that's good advice. But you feel like you can't. You feel *dependent* on the husband you think is taking advantage of you. 

And *that*, is a problem.

A problem that UBI addresses. 

The moment nobody *has to* take that Walmart job to feed their children, so many problems simply vanish. Yes, there will still be rich people. Yes, there will still be people cruising around in gold plated yachts. And that's ok. There's nothing wrong with that. Poverty is the problem here, not the rich.

You have to use a bit of common sense here.

&gt; it just shows they're less tolerant of Trump

No, because it was about tolerance of the people who hold those beliefs. Not the tolerance of Trump or Hillary. This would be like dismissing intolerance of Muslims by saying ""it's not that people are intolerant of Muslim's, it's that they are just intolerant of the religion"".

&gt; It's easy to find examples of almost anything on YouTube

Easier to find some things more than others though.

As for the studies, I would have to see them for myself. There are a lot of flawed studies out there and these institutions are dominated by the left. I've seen so many bogus arguments and methodologies from supposedly ""intellectual"" sources I have lost a lot of respect for these authorities. As close to primary info as possible is preferred, especially if the question is about this kind of oppression. And if oppression were happening, you'd possibly expect these studies to conclude that it wasn't.

&gt; Examples include a commencement speech at Yale that was shut down because of death threats against a speaker that's been critical of Trump

Yeah but what matters is the relative frequency and magnitude. I agree it obviously happens on both sides. The question is to what extent.

&gt; compiled a list of all University professors in Canada dismissed for political speech and found professors are more commonly fired for left-wing political views than right

Well there are far more left wing professors. So maybe this is an example of the kind of flawed/propaganda studies I was talking about.

&gt; Candice Owens and others you mention, like Shapiro, may be popular, but I don't think it's fair to imply they represent the average Conservative. If not alt-right, they are at least far-right

No. This is a really bad rationalization from you. They are not alt right. They are pretty mainstream. At worst they are as far right as Bernie Sanders is left. The fact you tried to use this as some sort of justification for their discrimination is just more evidence to support my point.

&gt; of the right to the far-left

The right is pretty tolerant of the far left. I don't see people attribute malice to those wearing a hammer and sickle. I do see it attributed to those who might wear a Trump hat, second amendment or pro-life t-shirt, etc.

&gt; What Monopoly?

You must be living under a rock. Honestly if you can't admit this then you wouldn't know anything even if it's staring you right in the face. The left-wing monopoly on these institutions is not debatable.

What do you think when you watch the Academy Awards and it's all ""F Trump, F Bush, Clinton is the best, shout your abortion, we need more gun control these Republicans want to kill our kids"" and so on? Do you think ""this is tolerant of conservatives, there's no monopoly here""? I mean come on.

&gt; The are multiple right-leaning media publications in the mainstream.

All the networks except Fox are left-wing. In Canada it's even more one sided if that's even possible. Again, if you don't see it, I'm not sure what to tell you. I guess I didn't notice it until I became conservative, so maybe it's easy to miss if you are on the left. Or maybe it's just gotten worse lately and that coincided with the shift in my own politics.

&gt; Big tech and public sector are dominated by the left? I disagree with that too.

Reddit, facebook, youtube, twitter, uh what?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbTXqrS9l5E

There is so much content on this man.

&gt; Musk is hardly left

So for every 10 on the far left because you can find 1 who is more center that somehow suggests there's not a monopoly? What? And Musk is not conservative. He's center but the fact you'd point to him as a conservative again is evidence of this oppression. The window is moving further and further left so more and more conservatives can be labeled extreme and their oppression justified. That's the culture that leads to you thinking Musk is a conservative, when he's really a centrist. And if he's the best you could come up with in big tech I think you need to take a step back and consider that perhaps you might not be correct and are just looking for a rationalization rather than the truth.

&gt; They aren't starving!

The people you listed gained their fame in a Hollywood that was more tolerant than it is today, or did so before coming out as conservative.

&gt; Sargon of Akkad is hardly mainstream. Very few conservatives I know have ever heard of him

By mainstream I meant ""standard"", not popularity. He's basically a classical liberal. 

&gt; he was also banned for using racial slurs while attacking the alt-right

Yes I'm well aware of what they said his ban was for. It was a stupid reason and an obvious hit job because of his politics, not the slur. If you believe it was because of the slur then you are being naive. He did not use the slur to disparage anyone. A common oppression tactic is to take things out of context to use as an excuse for your oppression - you'd see this for example when blacks were targeted in America. ""Hey that black dude cat called my wife I heard a whistle let's hang him!"". ""This guy said a racial slur let's shut him down! Nevermind the context or what he really was trying to say!"". When intent no longer matters for you to attribute malice to people, that's a bad sign.

&gt; that's very different from intolerance.

I didn't claim that decline was evidence of intolerance. Just that conservatism may not be in as strong a place politically as you suggested. My main point anyway was that it was a non-sequitur ""conservatives won some elections therefore there's not a concerning rise in discrimination against them"". Clearly both things can be true at once, and also the political spectrum is not binary (many conservatives of today would be classified as liberals 10-20 years ago).

&gt; Salvini's Northern League is decidedly not left-wing. Neo-nationalist, anti-immigration, anti-globalist... It's described as either right or far-right.

True but I was referring to M5S, the anti-establishment party, which if you're talking about the shifting politics in Italy is usually what people refer to. They are in a coalition with NL. M5S supports things like a universal basic income, so they are not right wing. Communists need strong borders to prevent their people from leaving, remember :) But anyway, this isn't really relevant.

Not to the same degree obviously. But in places, yes, we see that discrimination and I believe it is on the rise.

Intuitively if you want to think about why that is, realize that conservatives tend to view liberals as naive, whereas liberals tend to view conservatives as malicious (selfish, anti-gay, anti-woman, anti-poor, pro-school shootings, etc.).

"&gt; Our society is going to get more mechanized, there’s no way around it.

True, but you have to think about it from a perspective of possible outcomes.

I, for example, consider myself to be among the productive people.  But if we're being realistic, most people are not productive.  Most people offer society nothing more than the value of their own life, when you get right down to it.

And we are talking about a situation in which a tiny percentage of society is so utterly powerful that they are capable of taking care of the entire rest of the earth on their own.

How would you possibly go about enacting the de facto enslavement of these people?  

You only really have two options, because I assure you that the productive will never submit to such a system willingly.  The closest thing to willing you will get is probably techno-feudalism, at a dramatically reduced quality of life compared to the modern first world.  

So again you have two options.  You can vote for it, or you can use force.  Neither will be successful.  If a tiny percentage of the planet is so powerful that they can take care of the entire rest of the population, nothing you do can make them participate against their will.

You talked earlier about UBI deserving it's place at the table of discussion.  I disagree.  The table is there and the discussion may very well need to be had, but UBI is not a realistic or probable outcome.

To your point in another comment, the poor in the US are at a different level of poverty than these recipients, so we admittedly have less data on cash recipients from more developed countries.

That's right, though technically BI provides flat aid as well, but it does so for everyone so lacks the need for graduation. It's true that our current system could be more graduated, and economists for decades have urged that, but government has failed to execute on those ideas. I don't know exactly why that is, but imagine it's a mix of the need for simplicity when many programs offer complex benefits like housing and food stamps, inflexibility when it comes to budgets and estimation, etc. Some programs are partially graduated (e.g. housing subsidies reduce as income rises), but part of the idea behind cash is that it's the most flexible type of benefit, so to the extent that any other programs would have limitations on graduation (e.g. you'd never get kicked out of subsidized housing), cash would be free of those restrictions.",supportive,supportive

That will in turn create a signal that automating garbage collection would reap huge profits, so companies will be motivated to spend on R&amp;D to accomplish that, and then the price of garbage removal will decline again...

Unless you mean the various strength of demand/supply/price signals will change as a result of UBI, then, yes, of course.  That's not really an argument against it though.

It's odd how with UBI you often see a complete dichotomy of complaints against it.  One side seems to come up with ""you'll never be able to pay a big enough UBI that people could really live off it and it will just subsidize employers who pay shit wages"" and the other side is ""no one will ever work again and the economy will collapse"", as if there's some magic threshold of UBI amount before which, everyone is impoverished and suffering and after which everyone is fat and happy and no one would work.

It's bizarre.  It's obviously a smooth, though not necessarily linear, curve that increases the disincentive to work as the amount goes up.  It will never create a 100% disincentive though - not even close.  And it creates less disincentive than any conditional welfare program we have now.

The Infrastructure system many people will know is a massive nightmare.

1. a Univeral Basic Income

a common argument against the concept of raising the minimum wage is Small Businesses, I understand this and feel that we absolutely need to help Small Businesses as they are the backbone of our economy, as a result, I suggest that we fix the issues of workers needing more money through a Universal Basic Income, anyone who makes less than 100,000$ a year and is currently employed will be eligible, People who are not employed will still be eligible for unemployment benefits. The income would be 1,000 dollars a month, this amount was picked as it is enough to help minimum wage workers make ends meet and create savings which are good for the economy, however, it also does not run into the issue of people not working as you cannot live off of 1,000 dollars a month even if you did somehow get the UBI while not working.

1. Increased Administration

Obviously doing the above 2 would require massively increased administration and distribution, I would recommend creating low tier jobs for these allowing there to be more jobs in a very crowded market allowing for a further decrease in unemployment. This point will also be added to other aspects of life such as along our borders to prevent the separation and loss of families, and in gun stores to fix the occasional inconsistencies of background checks.

1. National ID Card

The creation of a National ID Card would phase out State ID Cards leading to less confusion regarding controlled substances, it would also come with an ID Card Number, this National ID Card Number would replace the Social Security Number with the goal of making the system far more secure to crack down on identity theft, Individuals will be able and required to obtain this ID Card upon the age of majority, 18 or possibly before if legally emancipated.

Russia has their hand on the tap and is threatening to turn it off.

For the first time in over *fifty* years. Russia has *always* been a reliable partner for trading, while other ""allies"" like the US don't hesitate to threaten their friends with economical warfare. A very big chunk of the German foreign policy was based on economical ties that would hurt both parties if they are broken, which was instrumental in creating the good relations that lead to the reunification. It wasn't a bad doctrine, it just didn't think that someone as mad as Putin could become the president of Russia

&gt;Look at what we achieved not in spite of covid, but because of it? This would be treated with the same urgency.

We made some minor advancements in medical stuff (and that was mostly field practice for an already upcoming procedure), but beyond that we ""achieved"" absolutely nothing. To balance out the sudden loss of Russian gas we would require to build LNG terminals, including gasification stations. There are physical limits on how quickly you can build, even if you wave most of the regulations.

&gt;Anyway, it's not about me having no idea, it's because I can't put a price on lives being directly impacted by our inaction

There is no guarantee, not even one on just a high chance, that stopping gas imports would slow down Russia. Hitler was rampaging around Europe for over half a decade despite going into insane debts. Russia isn't relying on imports, they can keep going for a long while.

And UBI does solve the problem, it means that those people without jobs that you were worried about will be able to afford to live while they seek alternative employment or retrain for a different career.

Someone has to pay for UBI. If one million people would lose their jobs just in Germany, that's *two percent* of all people here with a job, and a lot of that in very high paid jobs.

"My ideal approach would be deficit spending, modeled after the study by [The Roosevelt Institute](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Modeling-the-Macroeconomic-Effects-of-a-Universal-Basic-Income.pdf).

Another approach would be to include a [LVT](https://futurism.com/how-traditional-welfare-and-taxes-can-be-reformed-to-support-universal-basic-income) (alongside the VAT)

Land-Value Tax (LVT)

Last but not least, in fact in my opinion [**most important of all**](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/04/extreme-wealth-inequality-alaska-model) economically in the long-term as a new tax to increasingly replace existing taxes with, is a **tax on the unimproved value of land** — aka land-value taxation or LVT. Not to be confused with property taxes that tax what’s built on land, LVT taxes the total value of real estate minus what’s built on it. **The owner of a high-rise apartment building providing homes to hundreds of families would pay the same tax as an identical adjacent lot that stands empty, thus providing a disincentive to idle speculation and an incentive to develop unused and underused space**.

**The value of land is perhaps the best example of all of the wealth we all co-create, because the value of land depends entirely on everything and everyone that exists** ***around*** **it, not on it**. If all your neighbors burn down their houses, your house will be worth less. If all your neighbors fix up their houses, your house will be worth more. The increase in value is clearly *collectivel*y (not individually) generated.

**Since the 1980s, housing prices in the US have increased by 5% on average** (minus the real estate bubble creation and burst), which means a **5% tax levied on land values and distributed to all as basic income would be distributing the value created** ***by*** **everyone** ***to*** **everyone**. It would raise an **estimated $750 billion and function as an entirely unavoidable tax on both corporations and individuals alike**. It would also **serve alongside the VAT as an additional clawback mechanism, where all owners of land totaling more than $265,320 would pay more in LVT than received in basic income.**

**This combination would be hugely progressive, not only economically but racially, because the top 10% own 78% of all non-home real estate, and where the median white household has around $76,000 in home value wealth, the median black household has only around $1,500 in home value wealth**. In other words, under this plan, **median white households** (not counting any other taxes but LVT) would potentially be **net receivers of $9,466 in basic income and median black households would be net receivers of $12,966 in basic income**. For those hoping for [a UBI that provides extra as reparations](http://bostonreview.net/class-inequality-race/undercommons-no-racial-justice-without-basic-income), **this plan achieves that by clawing back less from African Americans, not for being African American, but for being systematically excluded from property ownership for centuries.**",supportive,supportive

"Der Hauptvorteil der Mehrwersteuer ist in der Realität die breite Base und dass Sie wesentlich schwerer zu umgehen ist, als andere Steuern, bzw. die Motivation der Umgehung geringer ist. Deswegen wird Mehrwertsteuer in UBI-Modelle eingebaut.

Mehrwertsteuer ist nie progressiv. Höchsten proportional. Das liegt daran, dass ein hoher Mehrwertsteuersatz, wie du es bereits gesagt hast, den Konsum verringert, wodurch dann weniger gekauft wird und ergo weniger Steuern gezahlt werden.

Eine Progressivität wäre nur dann gegeben wenn die Nachfragekurven der Luxugüter unelastisch wären, diese sind aber elastisch. Dies bedeutet, dass eine Änderung des Preises von einem %-Punkt des Preises den Konsum um mehr als einen %-Punkt in die entgegengesetzte Richtung verändert. 

Als Steuerungsmethode für den Konsum ist eine Mehrwertsteuer für Güter mit elastischen Nachfragekurven gut geeignet. Bei Gütern mit unelastischen Nachfragekurven, ist die Mehrwertsteuer ein gutes Instrument um für den Staat Einkommen zu generieren. Als progressive Steuer welche dem Ausgleich dient ist die Mehrwertsteuer aber absolut schlecht. Zum Beispiel, 2003 (ja ist eine Weile her) betrug die relative Mehrwertsteuerbelastung der Haushalte mit einem Haushaltsnettoäquivalenzeinkommens von 50-60% des Median ca. 10.8% und die der Hauhalt mit 150-175% hatten eine relative Belastung von ca. 7.6%.

Das Argument welches oft gebracht wird, ist das dies nur für periodenbezogene Analysen gilt, da angehäufte Ersparnisse irgendwann konsumwirksam werden. Mein Argument ist, dass dies gerade nicht der Fall ist. Angehäufte Ersparnisse stecken in Investitionen welche dazu verwendet werden mehr Ersparnisse anzuhäufen und um Einfluss auszuüben.

1. It will give the perception that everyone is treated equally.  It doesn't matter how much you make *everyone* gets the UBI payment.  This will prevent it from being considered another welfare system meant to punish the rich.

2. It incentivizes work.  If you go from 0-2K in your example, it will feel like you are being punished with a 1K penalty/tax as your UBI check decreased after getting a job.  Yes overall you are making more, and with higher tax rates it events out, but people are not rational and tend to be loss averse.  Losing that 1K will sting more than earning the 2k.  They will feel like they are being punished for trying to better themselves.

My own take on the topic involves questioning the capacity of markets to be free in principle. Meaning money is no absolute guide, meaning the less we are bound by it the more we can re-discover our sense to practice reciprocity (edit: you know people actually care about playing their part, about giving back where they're given; at least as long as we see in each other equals; the illusion of the free market also of course has the potential to wreck this). We got to do this in the first place unless we want to cultivate more and more narcissism on the one hand, more and more government/corporate surveillance on the other.

"*By Dr. Guy Standing, professor of development studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies and author of The Precariat: The New Dangerous Class, in which he argues that society must share the rental income gained by finance and capital investment in the global economy.,*

All over Europe, the precariat has grown sharply since 2008, although this emerging class, which has education but only intermittent, unstable labour, has been growing since the beginning of globalisation. The precariat faces chronic uncertainty, about what to do, about what incomes to expect, about state benefits that might be their due, about their relationships, their homes and about the occupations they can realistically expect.

Many are bewildered by lack of control over their time, suffering from what should be called a precariatised mind, not knowing what to do to give themselves a chance of a dignified life. Worst of all, they are learning that a large class of people habituated to a life of unstable labour is wanted by the globalised market system.

The precariat is not part of the squeezed middle, and accordingly has faced an increasingly hostile social protection system. Across Europe, not just in the UK, the old Beveridge and Bismarckian variants of the welfare state have been dismantled. In their place has been erected a mish-mash of means-tested, behaviour-tested social assistance, with a growing tendency to force young unemployed into workfare schemes, which are helping to depress real wages.

There is the rub. Globalisation began what should be called the Great Convergence, creating a globalising labour market in which wages in emerging market economies slowly converge with wages in rich economies, generating a steady drop in real wages across Europe.

Technological change has helped, by making production more scattered and mobile. But the drop in wages in the lower end of the labour markets of the UK and elsewhere, including Germany, reflects the cruel economic logic stemming from the trebling of global labour supply since the 1980s. Making it more painful is the fact that productivity is rising rapidly in those emerging market economies.

A feature of the globalising labour market is that the old link between productivity and wages stopped in the 1980s. Up to then, a graph of productivity growth and wages showed the two lines moving together. Since then the curves have diverged, leading to economists referring to the opening jaws of the snake – the wage curve has been flat or declining, the productivity growth curve has been accelerating northwards.



(Chart courtesy of the Economic Policy Institute.)

Governments have acted like Canute, trying to hold back the waves of downward pressure on real wages, through cheap credit, labour subsidies and the scam of the era, tax credits. But, to mix metaphors, the Faustian bargain this represented, by allowing an orgy of consumption, ended with a bang in 2008.

Since then, poverty, inequality and economic uncertainty have all risen remorselessly. Even if economic growth picks up, that will continue until governments change their thinking quite dramatically. Regrettably, there is not much intellectual courage around in our political establishment.

The current great white hope is the living wage. It is a good idea being oversold. In the UK, Ed Miliband has promised to introduce fiscal subsidies for “employers” (probably not including small firms) if they pay new employees the hourly living wage, which is higher than the statutory minimum wage. It sounds attractive to non-economists and politicians. Let me be a spoil-sport and be one of the first to predict it will lumber in for the first round, connect with a few hits and then prove a costly way of generating little benefit to a tiny fraction of the precariat.

Why? First, there are always huge deadweight effects with such subsidies. In other words, many of the tax rebates will go to employers who would have paid that wage anyhow. So, for every job actually created the fiscal cost will rise.

Second, there will be huge substitution effects. Employers will displace some employees with new hires who will entitle them to the tax rebate. That will hardly be fair. But again it will raise the effective cost of each extra job funded by the scheme.

Third, a wage subsidy lowers the dynamic efficiency effects of a normal wage rise. If, for example, labour costs rise as a result of a wage rise induced by bargaining, an employer will be under pressure to raise productivity. If the wage rise is financed by a subsidy, there is no such pressure. It is called the soft budget constraint.

Fourth, increasingly labour is being externalised, so that more and more workers are labouring from a distance, making it harder to ascertain what hours are being worked and what are being remunerated. Already, many workers are paid part-time but expected to labour many more hours. So, if an employer wants to put someone on the living wage, he can simply shorten the contractual hours.

Being entrepreneurial, employers will always stretch the rules. It is possible that the living wage will prove regressive, expensively worsening inequality in the lower rungs of the labour market. One hopes not, but it will not strengthen the bargaining position of the precariat one iota.

Living wage advocates should not misread this. We should favour the campaign. But it should not be oversold or financed by subsidies to employers, to capital. This was the folly of New Labour and its tax credits. It is the inequality that should be the primary target for reforms.

This leads to an option that should tick the boxes of progressives, once they accept that labour subsidies, tax credits and workfare are an ugly concoction that worsens inequalities.

Progressives and disillusioned social democrats should reflect on the thought that each type of economy has a distinctive system of distribution. Twentieth-century welfare state capitalism was historically unique, in that national income was split between wages and profits, labour and capital.

With globalisation, the share going to labour has withered everywhere, in countries as diverse as China, India, the UK, USA and Norway. In the future, the only way those relying on labour could raise their living standards will be by sharing the rental income gained by finance and capital investment in the global economy. We must imagine a new system of distribution, in which the whole of society receives a share of the rental income currently being taken wholly by financial capital.

This could be done by establishing a universal floor of basic security, through provision of a basic income for all resident citizens, or all legalised residents. It could start at a modest level, as it was in Alaska when it set up its Permanent Fund in 1976. It could be built up as subsidies to the rich and to large corporations were phased out.

It could have a fixed component set to rise as national income per capita rose, set by an independent committee, analogous to the current monetary committee. And it could have a second component, perhaps 20 per cent of the total, which could be adjusted counter-cyclically so as to make it a macro-economic stabiliser. It could even be labelled an Economic Stabilisation Credit (ESC), to give it legitimation.

Moves in this direction could be made by phasing out the array of regressive subsidies that never reach the precariat. It could also be partially funded by a Sovereign Wealth Fund, as now exist in over 60 countries. The Norwegians set one up with their North Sea oil, whereas Britain’s oil has ended up largely owned by Chinese state capital. But however funded, nobody should be allowed to deceive us by saying it is unaffordable. Soon it may be essential. Remember the billions given out to the failed banks?

Among the many benefits of moving towards an individual, unconditional basic income, or an ESC, would be that it would provide the precariat with an increased incentive to labour, whereas today millions of people face the opposite, confronted by poverty traps and precarity traps, as discussed in my recent books.

In the UK, the main poverty trap facing the precariat is a marginal tax rate of over 80 per cent, according to the government’s own estimates. If we are to believe Ian Duncan Smith, it might fall to 65 per cent if the ill-fated universal credit is ever implemented successfully. Meanwhile, the government eagerly cuts the tax rate for the rich to below 40 per cent, claiming that anything higher would be a disincentive to work and invest. And they wish to cut corporation tax to 20 per cent.

With a basic income, there would be no poverty trap. All earned income could be taxed at the standard rate, after tax allowances are taken into account. Today, the precariat has no incentive to take low-paying jobs of the type that will proliferate. So Duncan Smith resorts to coercion instead, with heavy-handed sanctions against the precariat, denied any due process. It is a shoddy way to treat people, and all of our major political parties support it.

There are other reasons, ethical and instrumental, for supporting a move towards a basic income. Psychologists (e.g., Frohlich and Oppenheimer, 1992) have shown that people with basic security work harder, are more productive, and are more altruistic and tolerant. They also have more confidence, which means they will be more likely to bargain for decent wages and working conditions, and join organisations that wish to do so. And people with basic security do more work that is not labour, such as caring for relatives and their communities. In having more control over their time, they can be more rational and plan their lives better. Progressives should wake up.

You apparently read absolutely none of my responses. I constantly said VAT is still regressive even after UBI is applied.

&gt;But he's not offering a VAT, he's offering VAT+UBI, and so you're *wrong* to call it regressive.

No I'm not, because it still results in poorer incomes paying a higher percentage of their incomes than richer incomes, so it's still regressive, even with UBI applied. Their incomes are higher now due to UBI, but they're still paying an unfairly high percentage of them to VAT. 

&gt;Yang is a pretty smart guy, and he's not constrained by establishment politics, big donors, etc. If there were other, better ways to fund a UBI than the VAT, he'd almost certainly be proposing them.

There are other better ways and they've been implemented before. A better progressive tax system which results in richer people paying a better share. Closing of tax loopholes to eliminate people avoiding taxes when they make more. Increased taxes on large corporations, or perhaps a more progressive tax system for businesses so that there is less of a burden on small businesses and more of a burden on large businesses. As a self employed person myself, my business is paying nearly the same percent as a business earning billions of dollars in profit and that isn't right at all. Then you also have decreases to military spending as well as cutting of existing welfare programs. All of these things together can MORE than pay for UBI, as well as generate a budget surplus that we desperately need.

UBI does not begin with that premise and it's hard to come up with a reason why it shouldn't be labor distortionary (reduce labor force participation).

Yes and when they do appear they should do so only after practical implementation and a time which has allowed us to see where there are problem and where we have been deluding ourselves. 

&gt;That may be UBI resting on income from automation taxes, or that could be regulation of automation to guarantee sufficient amounts of places for people to work. 

Or maybe it's neither of those things, ""they're taking ALL the jobs"" turns out to be absolute paranoia and Europe becomes the world's poorest shithole.

&gt; But whatever turns out to work best, we should start thinking about it as soon as possible.

""Thinking"" and working with practical data are two different things. 

&gt; If something turns out to not work as expected, or some completely unexpected development arises, there is still time to adapt. There won't be time to adapt if we wait till the problem has already fully formed. Then it might be too late for an easy solution.

And when the rest of the world is living in the Star Trek Utopia and we are the laughing stock of everyone else, would there be the time to acknowledge that we've made stupid regulations? 

It's like regulating spaceships at this point. 

Our differences seem to come from a single point - that we have enough information to create adequate regulations. You think we do, I think we don't. I very much doubt we're going to come to any sort of an agreement here. ",neutral,neutral
"Russia never managed to modernize, it was busy trying to maintain regional hegemony and its privatization methodology was extremely flawed, resulting in several oligarchs gaining power and the country receding back into authoritarianism.

On the other hand, you have countries like Estonia. When it became independent, its Prime Minister had read Friedman's ""Free To Choose"", so he respected free-market ideas. Friedman was consulted when the country's economic policies were being created and now Estonia is a developed country, what has happened there is known as an economic miracle. That's what happens when you implement capitalism properly.

The problem with socialism is two-fold. First of all, this: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem.

Second of all, the tendency of socialism to recede into authoritarianism every time it's implemented on a large scale is no coincidence. Socialism by its very nature (at least the socialism described by Marx) is supposed to use the state's power to ""stop the bourgeoisie counter-revolution"". This already means that you're handing over immense power to the state, and as Acton once said: power corrupts and absolute power, corrupts absolutely.

But other then the pretty quotes, socialism must abolish wage labor. The problem with that is that wage labor is completely natural. Me making a deal with someone, telling them I'll pay $15 for each chair they make, and then me selling those chairs is something very intuitive. I want to make a profit, while the worker wants the 100% assurance that he'll be paid. I might ""exploit him"" if I make a profit, but I might end up making a loss as well. When you tell humans they can't make arrangements like this, you are restricting a very basic freedom and that never ends well.

Sure there's problems with capitalism. You can argue that arrangements aren't actually free, that big businesses don't risk making a loss and are in a ""constant mode of exploitation"", but all of that is fixable with legislation. If you want the arrangements to be more ""free"" in the sense that you aren't forced to work somewhere because you have no other choice, then you can lobby an UBI. If you want to reduce the amount of big corporations with create problems, then you can support anti-trust laws. But socialism doesn't fix the problem, it only pushes it into the black market, where no legislation can help you heal. ",against,against

"&gt;Because I heard about the same fear mongering complaints and concerns 20 years ago and robots did not take over the world. We didn't lose jobs in the last 30 years because of automation. We lost those jobs because of free trade agreements. Those jobs were shipped to China, Asia, and Mexico which paid their workers pennies. We lost millions of jobs in middle America this way.


I'm not saying robots will take over the world. I'm saying they can replace enough jobs that would cause riots, and that is something to be discussed seriously, not dismissed because it didn't already happen.


&gt;I work in manufacturing and technology and though it is fundamentally true that we are looking at ways to make the process ""simpler""; at the end of the day 90% of the jobs will never be automated in our industry. The 10% that will be automated will take close to 10-15 years to implement. That's just the reality. 


I find that 90% number to be laughable: please, list the jobs you think that won't be automated.


&gt;Yes, I heard this talking point before. That's true to an extent. Automation will not exist in a vacuum. Whatever machine you would put to replace said job will also need to be maintained...I don't think our transition to the sci-fi future you are envisioning is as smooth as you think it will be.


Know what's neat about replacing a cashier with a kiosk? If it breaks down, that's fine: you ordered 8 of them. Stick an out of order sign up, and someone will repair or replace it. One thing you don't need is a full time repair guy on staff.


And I don't envision it to be smooth at all.


&gt;Why do Neolibs/Pubs have to fear monger this way? ""If we raise the minimum wage, corporations will leave"" or ""if we raise the minimum wage, we will immediately go to the year 2450 the next day"".

I don't think either of those things. What I think is that increasing the labor cost to a large degree will result in additional pressure to automate lower skill labor. Burger flipping robots aren't 10 years away. Everyone's already familiar with kiosks now. People are quite used to ordering things like clothing online, and ordering and paying for takeout on your phone isn't rare either.


&gt;Dude. Chill. Automation to the level that you are fear mongering right now is out at least 30 years. Will certain jobs transition to it sooner? Sure. But lets not pretend that there are 65M truck drivers in the US. If I am not mistaken, there is currently a shortage of truck drivers in the country. Automation can help meet those demand nicely - assuming people don't get killed left and right by automated trucks :)


What fear mongering? What exactly do you see my view as? It's not just ""these people will die"": a lot of people see what you do as an integral part of who you are. Fuel shortages in 2000 caused truckers to block highways: think they won't be doing it if they are replaced? Think ""but we need rural doctors and childcare specialists"" will help?


&gt;I don't believe we will face an issue with automation if or when Bernie is president but regardless, why is it stupid? Until Yang can come with a post work policy UBI plan, this ""issue"" has to be handled. A half-assed UBI plan won't do much other than streamline other welfare programs. With respect to that dystopian future I would expect that the majority of the people would be cheering on a the legislation to stop automation. We are a democracy after all.


I don't think that a 15/hr minimum wage is going to close Wal-mart. But legislating away automaton sure as shit will: assuming they'd be able to actually pull it off successfully without massive loopholes.


&gt;I imagine they will lose business. Businesses that will move to automation be boycotted and the real class warfare would be out in the open because let's face it. If the owners are fine and the working class isn't, it just proved that Bernie was right all along :)

Did McDonald's lose business when they put in kiosks? Did Amazon suddenly stop doing as much business when it came out how they were automating warehouse jobs? You seem to think that most people see the business practices (that don't negatively affect them personally) of a company as a major deciding factor behind a purchase. For some it is: they don't buy any nestle products, they never shop in Wal-Mart, they don't use Amazon, they only eat out in local stores. Most don't give a fuck if it's cheaper.

Regarding financial resources and supply curves, see a screenshot of a recent JP Morgan research document depicting the Fed's [vertical supply curve](http://subbot.org/misc/econ/vertical_supply_curve.png) for reserves.

Marriott raised prices to deal with falling demand (see [a tweet](https://twitter.com/JWMason1/status/1126509329446649861), since deleted, but with remaining comments that mention the reverse pricing). Also, [""Apple will continue to raise prices to offset falling unit sales growth.""](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/apple-raising-prices-to-offset-unit-sales-growth-decline-14779830)

"&gt;UBI only works if we get cost of living in check. 

Not everybody is a single head of household. Tel  a homeless guy living under a bridge that a couple hundred dollars of guaranteed money coming in reliably every month is a waste of time because it's not ""enough to live on.""

Or consider a couple with a child where both parents work. Imagine the child is in daycare and the mother is working part time in the mornings. Since there are two adults in the household, they'd _each_ ge betting a UBI check. Let's say it's $300. That's not anywhere near their cost of living, but $600 between the two of them might be enough that the motehr could quit her part time job and stay at home with the kid. Better for them, better for the child.

UBI pretty much _can't_ be ""cost of living"" anyway, because fundamental to the premise is that everybody gets the same amount, and cost of living isn't the same everywhere. $1000 might be enough to live on in Nowheresville, Kentucky, but it's not going to do much in San Fransico where a one bedroom apartment is $3000+. 

&gt; If everyone gets $1k extra per month you can expect rent to increase $1k per month. 

That doesn't make sense. UBI doesn't eliminate standard market forces and it doesn't make supply and demand magically cease to exist.

Imagine you _did_ receive $1000/mo UBI and your landlord _did_ raise your rent by that same $1000. Would _you_ pay it? Or would you simply go somewhere else? Personally, I'd leave, and I expect that a lot of other people would too. 

Let me guess...you're imaginging all landlords in the world all conspiring together to raise their rents by the same $1000? That's obviously not going to happen. [Here's](https://www.apartments.com/river-walk-apartments-wichita-ks/gdpwf9z/) a one bedroom apartment in Wichta, Kasnsas for $515/mo. [Here's](https://www.equityapartments.com/san-francisco-bay/mission-bay-apartments) a one bedroom apartment in San Fransico for $3800. Do you _really_ think they're both going to go up by the same exact $1000?

But hey...let's suppose they do. Now imagine a guy barely skating by, working part time at McDonald's nd living in that $515 apartment. Imagine he starts getting $1000/mo from UBI. Imagine that the next day his rent jumps up to $1515/mo. Is he going to shrug and pay that, or is he going to quit his job and live on the $1000/mo? I think he's going to walk away. The $1000 is probably more money than he had left over after rent before UBI, and he has too many alterantives available to him to be stuck paying it. He can get a roommate. He can rent a room from some elderly couple with a spare bedroom. People with mortages are already locked into loan rates, so it's not like they even _hjave_ a landlord who can raise their rent by that magic $1000/mo. For that matter, with $1000 he can probably just hop in his car and go on a cross country road trip and call it a vacation. He's not stuck accepting that $1000/mo rent increase. He options now, because he has pasive income . He's not tied to his location the way he was before basic income. If rents rise too much, he can simply go somewhere else.

For that matter, roommates alone breaks your premise. Imagine a single guy living in a $1000/mo apartment living next door to a couple both living in the same apartment, paying the same $1000/mo. UBI comes along, and all three of them are now getting an extra $1000. How exactly does the rental company raise rent in order to capture all that money? They can't raise rent by $1000 on one apartment and by $2000 for the next apartment over.

What about people who own theirs homes and aren't paying rent at all? What about people in the military living on base? What about people who do seasonal work where living arrangements are provided, cruise ships, ski resorts, etc?

If you're imagining rent being raised by exactly as much as UBI and it all just magically goign away and making no difference...that's very obviously not what would happen.

As has been pointed out elsewhere, UBI as high as $1000/mo would probably result in rental rates going _down_ in a lot of places. There are [17 million](https://247wallst.com/housing/2019/09/30/there-are-over-17-million-vacant-homes-in-america/) vacant _houses_ in the US, and everybody getting $1000 would create a lot of opportunity for lenders to put people into mortgages. Everybody who moves into a house is one less renter on the market, and we then run into fixed rental supply suddenly competing for a lot less demand for rentals.

"&gt;But honestly that is besides the point. What I would truly be worried about is how this would affect society's mentally as a whole. Basic income is synonymous with automatically earning money in that no matter how little hours or how little effort I put into my work, I will still be rewarded the same amount of money.

That's not how most basic income programs work. The general idea I've seen (and the one I think will be the most effective) is that everyone gets an equal basic amount to live off of, and then whoever chooses to work earns that income *on top of* their basic income. 

This way we can ensure everyone has enough to live off of, and do away with the waste involved in determining who deserves what.

&gt; Why then, would anyone want to better themselves and be a productive part of society? Most people do because they have the reward of being able to provide for themselves, but in this situation that incentive is now gone. This will create a lazier and lazier country that we just can't afford to have (especially if robots are such a big threat).

You have a pretty poor image of humanity if that's your opinion.

Have you literally never done anything worthwhile that you weren't paid for? Have you never been curious to understand how something works, or to learn a new skill, or to create something?

I believe human beings have an inherent curiosity about the world around them, a desire to make that world a better place, and a need to be active so they can look back at their day to see what they've accomplished. Of course there will always be exceptions, but I think laziness is more often a symptom of a greater problem, like depression, which can be caused by being trapped working a job you hate in order to make ends meet.

Imagine if you weren't forced to take whatever job you can get in order to put food on the table, and instead had the freedom to do *any* kind of work that interested you? How much more motivated would you be to go to work each day if it was completely your choice, and was exactly the kind of work you wanted to do?

So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors.

"I think 2 is likely insufficient, since the ""replacement rate"" is 2.1 children per woman. So, 2 is certainly not ""ideal"" if we want to reap even some of the benefits of reproduction, such as a growing economy, rising levels of health and longevity.

At the same time, human dynamics are somewhat predictable and/or ""patternizable"". One exceptionally consistent pattern I have noticed across dozens and dozens of families with 3+ children is, once the number of children reaches 4 and/or increases ad boinkulatum, the children seem to sort of automatically ""organize"" themselves into groups, almost as if there is some sort of familial ""middle management"" going on; so, mom and dad seem to tend to only ""need"" to be addressing at most 3 at a time. If the ""middle management"" hypothesis is correct, such a hypothesis would explain the statements of the families you have seen.

As for why some couples limit themselves to 2, the reasons are various, including but not limited to money, apprehension of difficulty due to the lack of awareness as it relates to the middle-management hypothesis, living space (which goes back to money), health care (which goes back to money), the occasional ignorant mocking from individuals who think others should have fewer children or who simply don't have children, etc.

This fact is why I think the best way, and maybe the only way, out of the baby bust is a robust universal basic income (UBI), where every citizen (mom, dad, and child alike) each receive a minimum income of, for example, a thousand dollars a month.

"Democratic Socialist here and I **support** defending Ukraine and providing them aid.

All my life (41 years old), we have been involved in one conflict or another, either directly, passively, or indirectly (proxy). Arguably I do not recall a time of true peace without the continued threat of more conflict and those profiting from conflicts, within the so-called ""Military-Industrial Complex."" Nearly all of those conflicts have been for oil or other resources or strategic assets and seldom ever because it was the right thing to do.

And yes, while it may align with our interest to help Ukraine, this time I can say we are fighting or supporting the effort with truth, justice, and moral-ethical reasons. We are not nation-building and Ukraine is not rich with oil or some other valuable resource we plan to plant our flag upon (metaphorically speaking) and claim as our own. We are saying, along with many of our allies that what Russia is doing is wrong. We are standing against oppression and tyranny, along with standing against imperialism by Russia and the wrongful attempted annexation and invasion of a peaceful sovereign nation, Ukraine. 

No one reasonably likes war or confrontation and certainly, we as a country (USA) have been involved in more than our fair share, and although I wish Russia has never decided to attack Ukraine, now that they have, I feel it is the right thing to defend and support Ukraine anyway we can. 

I am a democratic socialist and my only dislike is that this is another reminder yes, we do have the money for universal healthcare, education, universal basic income, infrastructure, etc., and, unfortunately, we continue to argue we do not, while we forever invest in more conflict.

"I love how people like you don't understand the idea that the 1%'s hoard of wealth would be depleted almost immediately if it were used to fund their pipe dreams.

Data from wikipedia says that in the USA, the top 10% (not even looking at a mere 1%) held 70% of the wealth... Q3 2019 that was $70.4tn.  For simplicity, we'll magically assume that's all liquid wealth - it's not, actually, and that complicates things greatly, but that isn't even needed to show you how silly your plan is.

By any reasonable estimate, UBI is a net consumption of wealth.  Most realistic estimates say that once you roll social security and welfare in, it's going to cost taxpayers $2tn per year to make up for the deficit.

Which means that you need to start drawing $2tn per year from your wealthiest.

Problems with that:
1) They move their money, and themselves if they need to, away from your reach.  You won't have access to that money, or them.  You can bet they aren't going to want to shell out $2tn a year.
2) That's an unsustainable debt load.  Even they can't afford that.
3) When it becomes not worth the effort, they stop making the effort.  Billionaires like Bezos et al aren't going to bother with the effort.  Now you've got even fewer jobs, because why would they bother making a company that doesn't make them any money?

"Now we're getting into further details, which again, people will have lots of different ideas for. I'll give my personal ideas, but note that things vary.

A solid amount of countries have an economic panel that gets together every so often to see what the minimum wage should be and raise it accordingly. This stops inflation and time from rendering that living wage a poverty wage, helping both people and the economy since people can spend. I believe something similar could be done with UBI. Keep in mind though that if you have UBI, it isn't just tacked onto a system, it has to be integrated. The rest of the economy would work with UBI the same way that UBI would work into the economy. There would have to be discussion on things like stopping the housing rental market from trying to absorb all of the money, and other things that would likely come into play. This is economics, and honestly, I can't get that sweaty with getting into all the tiny details, I won't be able to cover all my bases since I'm just one guy on reddit.

My point is, people can always want more UBI, right now people want to pay less taxes and also want the government to do more, people want a higher minimum wage etc, but it doesn't always happen. Maybe if it gets too low people may mass protest, maybe not. In south korea, from what I gather, people didn't immediately want more, they were just grateful for the program and did things like go to school, change career paths, etc. so I think more people will be happy as long as it maintains the definition for a basic income, that is, a wage you can cover the basics of living with (korea didn't do exactly this, but that's for another day). Unless it goes way below, I doubt there would be massive protests, and at that point, maybe it does need to be raised anyways.",supportive,supportive
"&gt; What I mean is this: Right now you're working in a job that you hate. Or struggling to hold onto a job that doesn't pay well (your post is unclear on which of these, possibly both). So let's say a BI was implemented and you could say ""fuck this, I'm outta here"" (assuming your employer didn't freak out and improve pay / working conditions during the mass exodus of their lowest rung).
&gt; You return home, collecting that steady paycheck, and do whatever you would do with an infinite amount of spare time and just barely enough money to cover food and rent. Probably watch TV, surf the Internet, maybe go for some walks...
&gt; For the first time in your life, you feel free of the shackles you had on before. You don't have to work, because fuck those guys, they were always taking advantage of you anyway, and god dammit you need some - admittedly well deserved - time off. That's completely okay. Everyone deserves time off. Everyone deserves a paid vacation from work. Life at the bottom can be fucking stressful and awful, and you damn sure don't have the luxury of taking any time off under the current system. Who can afford that?
&gt; But you know what? Once you no longer have that pall of misery hanging over you - being forced to work a shitty job for low pay and no time off - I think you'd find the desire to work at doing something productive - something you like (or can tolerate) - would return. Maybe in a few weeks, maybe in a few months. Who knows.

I was fired about a year ago, and haven't been able to land myself a new job since. I do feel I was taken advantage of, but I know it was also a matter of my inexperience not having me make use of the benefits that I was entitled to (taking a few more sick days when I needed them would likely have saved my employment), and putting a little too much energy into the job due to zealous and friendly colleagues. While the head office didn't provide much support, I did enjoy the job. But alas, I was fired.

With basic income, I wouldn't bother getting a new job, because fuck the job market, and fuck employers. I'd rather spend my time writing my super-bestseller and make my soon-to-be-world-famous music and things like that. When I'm not climbing rank in LoL, thatis. Maybe I'd feel like I'm not achieving anything in life. But weighing my options of just collecting free money doing nothing, and working hard just to find work, I'd rather take my money and spare myself the trouble.

And that's where I think a lot of people, whether they got burned or never made it to the bakery, would rather not bother trying. Energy is an economy too, and if it's too difficult to find a job, you'd rather not try.

I'd be much better off with a job than with free money. While free money is a great thing when you need it (and many people, despite their jobs, do, for various reasons), a lot of people don't, but would rather take it than work.

"Free education. UBI. Planned economy to fulfil people’s needs such as shelter, food, water and medicine(mental health included). Abolition of jobs as a means to survive. I’m haven’t decided yet if I’m opposed to a market in general, but I’m definitely opposed to a market for things people need to survive. Life should be societally guaranteed.

There are obviously jobs that are necessary for that vision. If medicine, food and shelter are to be guaranteed, then someone HAS to do those jobs. 
For lower skilled labour that doesn’t require much training I’d propose a civil duty. So that the effort was split between hundreds of people. Requiring that you basically do one shift a month to clean public facilities or deliver goods or maintain a warehouse, etc. 
For higher skilled jobs that take years of training, like farmers and doctors at first perhaps a bonus to your UBI. And only certain amount of hours that have to be covered, so that if there are more of total personnel available, every single person would be asked to work fewer hours.
In time, even that incentive I believe would be unnecessary. There are thousand of people who pursue sciences and medicine and farming despite hardships those jobs bring and the financial risk they pose. People want to work and want to help other people. If education was free, there would be an enormous amount of skilled labourers. More than is necessary to cover every societal need. And UBI would insure that in this case they wouldn’t need to compete with each other, but instead could work together.

That’s my take. There is definitely a need to refine that vision, but the general gist is this: I want people to work together to lessen the amount of suffering this world has to see happen.

From an economic standpoint what matters is the marginal tax rather than the average but as long as the marginal rate is below 30% or so the distortions aren't too bad.

You'd have to tune the numbers but lets say we decide we want a flat tax of 35%.

"&gt;We're a long, long time away from needing to consider basic income, despite what some people might want you to believe.

Unabashed lie. Basic income is already a necessity for this current society. We have whole sections of society that lives in a barbaric subversion of society where stealing and killing is a regular part of life. Maybe these people wouldn't have to live in squalor if we as a society gave them a piece of something that was created collectively.

We need to consider giving people a means to live in modern society, participate, and then subsequently give back. So many people are lost in the cracks that could've possibly have given us so much, but never got the opportunity because poverty is toxic and it spreads itself through communities until they are reduced to savagery.

The coming of automation is a great boon to the basic income movement. But its something we should've considered long, long ago. Poverty is at the heart of crime, gun violence, and a plethora of problems. We have enough to give.

"A thoughtful write up, thank you for taking the time to go into such detail.  
In my mind, the biggest obstacle to a bright future isn’t the specific policy differences, but the opposition they’ll face. I’m surprised to learn that Yang’s healthcare plan is actually more likely to garner Republican support, but on the whole I’m of the opinion that Yang’s policies are something we should eventually work towards, Bernies are something more actionable in the short term, and even draw from ideas Americans have already seen work under F.D. Roosevelt. 

For example, Yang’s flagship position, UBI, isn’t ready for primetime. What stops landlords nation-wide from simply raising rent by a thousand a month? There’s already an affordable housing shortage. While an extra grand every month sounds nice on the surface, I’m scared we’ll implement it in a way that doesn’t afford poor and middle class families any extra buying power, and instead simply results in them writing larger checks for the same things every month. As the threat of automation looms, UBI is going to become a critical tool in maintaining a healthy economy, but only if we get it absolutely right. This should be the result of rigorous debate, a debate a lot of Dems still aren’t capable of having, let alone drawing Republicans into. 

Just look at how much the platform of the Democratic party has changed over the last couple elections. This is why a Bernie Presidency built on compassion and progressive ideals would do a lot to help frame the conversation. 

Like you, Bernie’s age concerns me, so I’m curious to see what kind of VP or cabinet choices he would make. I’d like to think we could see Warren/Bernie/Yang all playing roles in each others cabinets. As you put it above, they all recognize the same problems, and agree that larger steps are required to fix them. At the end of the day, as long as a progressive wins I’m happy.

"&gt; well what law are you going to pass to take it? 

You don't need to pass any law. You just need to enforce the laws we currently have. Until now, both the Liberals and Conservatives have been unwilling to do that, because they are owned by these corporate interests. Fortunately, unlike their American counterparts, they also seem to have a soul. 

&gt; Many may just start re-investing into the business.

This isn't possible. The major, glaring flaw in capitalism is very simple. If the purpose of investing is to make money, why would anyone invest their money if they already have all the money. It's the monopoly problem. Eventually you have everything, and creating anything new would mean a loss in your personal profits. Giving a basic income to the citizens doesn't mean money for you, so it's pointless to do. 

And what businesses would they invest in? Ones that are providing a service to who? People who have no money to buy from their businesses? How does that work? 

The ""job creators"" want you to think they're important, but they're just worthless middlemen withholding currency in order to extort the populace for their labour, which is actually valuable. Businesses can't survive if no one has any money, just like a parasite won't bother attaching itself to a corpse. 

&gt; That wealth was accumulated over several years/decades lets pretend they're 100% ok with us taking it away well that pool will dry up pretty fast and then what?

Again, spent money doesn't vanish. Hoarded money does. Spent money circulates in the economy and ends up back to the government, which redistributes it. If you cut out the worthless middlemen, and their objectively terrible practice of hoarding, which is now bordering on mental illness, then instead of that money sitting in worthless black holes, it circulates in the society. 

Again, spent money doesn't vanish. When you buy a coffee, that money is collected by the coffee shop owner, who then spends it on clothes at a clothing store. The clothing store owner then spends it on something, and they spend it one something, and they spend it on something. All the while, it's being taxed, which returns it back to the government for redistribution. It's a system that already exists, we're just saying that we have the capital to start a distribution engine called a ""basic income."" 

&gt; Unless you buy everything from factories in China, these middlemen end up hiring a lot of people in the country...

Even they're not so blind as to deny that they'd still be fabulously wealthy in any case short of a full seizure and redistribution of their assets. No, instead it's some vague fear about ""threatening the economy.""

The idea that somehow the economy would be weakened with more money in the pockets of more people is laughable. Just about any reputable economist who isn't beholden to either the interests of the ultra-rich or a skewed ideology would argue the opposite. Even in a system as fucked as ours, more money in more hands only *strengthens* the economy. It's absurd to say that it wouldn't. Even the most cursory study in economics demonstrates this. More money in more hands = more spending power, which drives economic growth. People aren't just going to stick their thumbs up their asses and not work any more than happens already. Most people *want* to work, but they don't want to work for peanuts or be abused by their employers.

The only aspect of the economy that would be threatened is the part that only affects the ultra-rich. Does it take potential profits out of their hands? Sure, but they're obviously fine regardless. What they're actually blind to is the fact that what we'd collectively gain as a society would ultimately be in their best interests as well. If you push a society too far, it breaks down. You'll have an increase in crime that affects the ultra-rich. You'll have civil unrest, political violence, maybe even a civil war or a revolution if things get too bad. That's bad for business in most cases. And it's especially dangerous in a modern, global community with advanced technology that can cause untold destruction. Even a smaller-scale conflict in the context of a changing economic climate and actual, *literal* climate change could upset markets and their way of life far more than any tax hike.

Personally, even if I were an evil billionaire, I'd rather rule a nice world than a nasty one. I'd prefer a green pasture to scorched earth. I'm sure there are a few Sauron-types mixed in who would get off on being a Mad Max-style warlord or something, but most of them are too old and soft for that.

"Fair enough. My previous argument wasn't that strong, you're right about that. It isn't simply that the USA is more right leaning, that can't be the only reason why I think that the right is stronger in the sense that they push the entire debate towards the right.

It's a difficult discussion anyway. What is right and what is left wing? Usually there's three things mentioned. Economic, government influence and social issues. I think government influence should totally be disregarded in the debate. I don't think right wing or left wing necessarily has to have high or low government influence. For example, communism is stateless, but it requires a strong government to implement it. Anarchism is similar to communism, they're both left wing, same ideals, except they think government has to be abolished in order to achieve communism. Then you have fascism, which has a strong government too. Typically, most right wing parties want to remove government influence, though, like Trump. I hope we can agree to disregard government influence on the left/right scale in this discussion.

Then you have social issues. This is usually where progressive and conservative come from. In my opinion, you don't have to be left wing in order to be progressive. I think we should really focus on economic issues in order to determine left and right wing. I think it's the most interesting anyway. 

The reason why I think everything has shifted towards the right, is because in my opinion, socialism is left wing and right wing is capitalism. But even those on the left, like Bernie Sanders, think that capitalism is absolutely necessary. 

Some might say there's still a lot of left wing policies like minimum wage and universal basic income. I don't think many of these are specifically left wing, though. It's still based on right wing economic principles.

I think that the issue is right now we need people to have a living wage. That might cause some inflation yes but it needs to happen because what we have now does not work. Minimum wage increase gets added onto all our benefits and asks companies to pay this extra burden as opposed to just tax payers paying for this $1k a month. Where does that $1k a month come from?

Yang's nebulous statements that he would just help out families in circumstances like these overly complicates a much simpler solution: let it stack. For the households that will be organically lifted past the threshold, awesome. For the households that still qualify, even more awesome.

"&gt;Figures I would get lost in my own thoughts and give short shrift to the actual things I was here to talk about.

I'm not saying you did, I just think we disagree on things.

&gt;Part of my point is that it is ungodly difficult to work yourself out of poverty, and there is no rational reason for society to want to retain that difficulty. Certainly many people do work themselves out of the ghetto, but I don't think anyone will argue it is any more than a tiny minority who do. 

I'd argue that with you. The very first study I googled says:

&gt;http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/411956_transitioningpoverty.pdf

&gt;On average, poor individuals have a one in three chance of escaping poverty in any given year. Blacks, households headed by women, and households with more children have a lower probability of getting out of poverty. Higher education levels improve the likelihood of leaving 
poverty. 

&gt;• Roughly half of those who get out of poverty will become poor again within five years. For those who were poor for at least five years and then escaped poverty, more than two-thirds will return to poverty within five years (Stevens 1994). People cycle in and out of poverty over the 
course of their lives, which can add up to a significant number of years in poverty. 

Now this doesn't even go into the ""Why"" question... It is and always will be clear to me why the guy who speaks broken english and wears his pants around his ankles will always be poor. His only option to be rich is to become a famous rapper. And yes... that is not likely.

One in 3 chance of escaping poverty is not a tiny minority. I also think if you look at who in that 1 in 3 tends to make it - they have a very specific set of work ethic and effort to participate in society or business that really makes their chances much higher than the other 2 they leave behind in poverty. It doesn't matter what color your skin is, if all you want to do is smoke blunts and talk about the man keeping you down and talk shit all day - you really have narrowed your options for escaping the poverty. Many people wear that poverty as a badge of pride. ""Being REAL"", and that attitude goes a long way to imprisoning them in poverty.

&gt;  Sure Barack Obama grew up relatively poor,

Huh? He grew up with his mom traveling the world, in Hawaii with his grandmother and grandfather and went to a high price prep school... 

&gt;Claiming what? I just don't really understand any of this at all.

Income on their taxes. I was laying out one example of how a person abuses the existing safety net. I was trying to use an example of a family that claims they only make 20,000 a year, and leaves out the 30,000 or 40,000 they make in cash. This type of behavior allows them to claim benifits they would not get otherwise. There is also the person who sells their benifits for cash, for example. Sorry i wasn't more clear.

&gt;So, at the end of the day there will always be some who manage to find a way to slip through whatever net we provide, no matter how thoroughly we attempt to keep then afloat.

I agree, there will always be people who abuse any system. That is more reason to create a system that is more difficult to abuse, isn't it?

&gt;Certainly some will fall through, and as I said, I think their should be targeted programs to help them pull themselves up and seek treatment. But I think it is a mistake to try to address it from the front end by trying to create highly targeted benefits that try to limit their capacity for abuse or target the recipients. It created monstrous overhead, enormous gaps in coverage, and does not truly alleviate the abuse it seeks to remedy.

I guess in order to even come close to taking the Basic Income idea seriously, I would need to see some kind of numbers on what all of that would cost.

I have relatives in other countries and they are paying way less for the exact same drugs bec companies are screwing us Americans thanks to our weak laws.  [https://www.yang2020.com/policies/prescription-drug-costs/](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/prescription-drug-costs/)
   3. Expand access to medical professionals, example: enable nurse practitioners to perform more procedures .  When nurses can do more work, that will reduce our healthcare costs.

   4. Promote telemedicine and other innovations.  [https://www.yang2020.com/policies/medical-technology-innovation/](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/medical-technology-innovation/)
3. If cost of living is too high in an area, and you can't afford to live there even with UBI, then UBI enables you to move to a lower cost area.  Unlike salary from a job, UBI follows you wherever you go.  Think of what that will do to revitalize smaller towns.

"People like always are not thinking this through in its entirety. They claim no one else but them is critically thinking about this. So here it goes:

Free money isnt free. The government will attempt to tax the rich. They will leave. And before someone says ""Oh well if they werent paying their taxes then fuck em, leave."" They most likely had businesses and small factories that might have employed 1000s of people. Now thats all shipped off to China. Businesses and jobs will leave. Price gouging will begin because there are no consumer protection laws in Canada that will stop this. 

They will then go after the upper middle and middle class. 

What also gets me is that...a lot of people in the upper middle-middle bracket work rather essential jobs and in many cases they work lots of hours and irregular hours. Take for instance my occupation (HVAC). Working 40 hours a week and taking two weeks off per year you in the GTA (rates do vary across the country) you gross about 90k. Most workers of my skill level make about 115-130k per year gross. Why? Not because of side work. But because you get things like shutdowns (ie someone smelled a foul fart and called the fire department. They shut off the gas supply and Embridge does a pressure test on the line and finds a tiny drop in the pressure test). Where we end up working for days on end sleeping in our trucks for a couple hours here and there but basically were not home for a couple days until weve fixed every single problem in what could be a 200 unit apartment/condo. 

This isnt limited to our trade. Plenty of work happens during non-prime hours to avoid disruptions. These also pay a premium. But now the ones who will bear the brunt of this are people in the medical professions. Doctors being taxed to death so some snowflake can get stoned and work on their 360 no scope. And last I checked-we were in short supply of doctors. 

Were just supposed to do our jobs out of a labour of love? 

My prediction is this:

1. UBI is implemented. Based on the average income and cost of living related to the GTA (as I cant speak for the rest of Canada) we would see a system where 40-50k a year and under you receive the full amount. Between the minimum and we will say 100k a year, you are subsidized. Over that and over a certain amount of hours per week (lets say 32 because that what the plinkos think is a work week) you are taxed at 90%. Basically once you hit hour 32, you are working for free.
2. With the new need for extra man power to cover those not wanting to work for free, and people being absolutely lazy, you now see a labour shortage. Que the borders being spread wide open. The intent is we bring in skilled individuals from other parts of the world to fill the gaps with on the job training to get them up to our standards. Problem. They find out you can shove 5 people over 18 into an apartment and make 10k a month. Well ill be dipped. Why go to work when you can live for free.
3. Working class professionals hardest hit by the UBIs claw back taxes will end up either moving south, or somewhere else where their occupation isnt reduced to rubble. The end result is now an under skilled work force as the experienced hands are few and far between. 
4. As standards begin to slip: Welcome to the new 3rd world.

That's a fundamental misunderstanding... You can't tax multinational corporations as easy. It gets muddy pretty damn quick.

Hell would freeze over before the IRS and Bernie/Warren cabinet make/enforce a bill that won't be gamed by Amazon's lawyers. It will be hard for the IRS to do it to wealthy people, but it will be much much harder to do it for corporations. 

It's a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem of automation. Taxing corporations is nothing like taxing wealthy people. And tech companies don't have to higher more workers to increase their revenue(more workers=more tax revenue generated), hence why some UBI proponents said we should have an automation tax, but we haven't started experimenting with this at all, and if we do do anything about it, tech companies will start acting like a government of their own, and no body wants that!

There is still the labor shortage in the farm worker employment, where nobody wants to have a job as a picker or weeder or plucker, all day long, day after day. The low unemployment with declining production employment means all those other commercial service jobs, which includes managers and supervisors, are growing due to growing consumer demand for the products of automation, the service being the handling, transportation, and marketing of the product.

"&gt;The only way change happens is when the people force it. Its a bottom up process. Politicians only make moves when they are forced.

I hate this myth.

Politicians make moves when they are forced to, but just because they make a move doesn't mean it ultimately amounts to anything progressive for the working class or their supposed constituents.

""Organic""/""spontaneous"" movements that become a part of the prevailing ""common sense"" (referencing Gramscian concepts here), provide the illusion of consent and a bottom-up process, but they ultimately become co-opted. The early socialist movements as well as the Communist Party are perfect examples of this. 

It's much more likely your earlier point will prevail:

&gt;The democrats will most likely run some cookie cutter corporate dem, will give lip service to the working class and then sell them out if they win. Which is pretty standard.

Any meaningful change occurs when someone from the ruling class (or even someone from a lower class who ""sells out"" and proves themselves to the upper classes) is able to convince enough of the ruling class to co-opt and implement values of ""the people"" that are being championed in a popular bottom-up ""common sense"" way.

On the one hand, this seems to prove your point, but you also need someone enmeshed and entrenched ""on the inside"" to actually meaningfully persuade and convince enough of the power holders. The problem is, once they're ""in"", they often become complacent and champion lip service over meaningful change.

The crux of Marxes argument was that Capitalism relies on the ability to extract labour from a worker in return for some capital and that less a worker is involved in the generation of said capital, less the worker would be valued. He mentioned for a pre automation society where men are needed to perform all mechanical tasks, the capitalist system would actually work great. But the nature of capitalism will always incentivize the worker to negotiate for better and capitalist to seek to reduce the worker's negotiation power, till technology advances far enough or population increases large enough that negotiation power of the worker will only continue to decline. Thus a slow transition away from capitalism is required to ensure workers could maintain their welfare even when their labour value diminishes. 

This is what is happening in the USA, and that is why we are in a bad position, because we as workers have very little to no negotiating power in the system, hence our inputs are only mildly better at moving the needle.

Economics, much like language is not an intrinsic factor of universe, but a human construct, and just as language, it is often restricted by the technology available, that is why over time as technology increased so did nature of economy and government as well. Communism failed in USSR and others because there were no logistical mechanisms to maintain accountancy and even now one cannot say it can be maintained. However, as technology evolves, one can use it to enshrine accountability and give far more power. But that would need people to understand the limitations of capitalism, communism, and where there is a middle ground and where it can be effectively implemented. 

I won't support communism now because Labour is still needed, resources are plenty but not immeasurable and accountability of fairness is not possible on such large scale.

"Automation. Manufacturing, especially, is relying more and more on automation. That means that many previously existing well paying jobs that required no education are being phased out in favor of machines that can do the same job faster, safer, and cheaper. As a result of *that* huge swaths of the American rust belt are losing (or have already lost) their jobs. This leaves them vulnerable to populist propaganda that claims it can bring their jobs back ""from overseas"", completely ignoring that many of the jobs *didn't go overseas*.

The sad fact of the matter is that most of the manufacturing jobs that are no longer present in America are simply *gone*, and are **never** coming back. That's a result of automation. As we continue to make automation more and more sophisticated it will eliminate additional industries. For instance, self driving cars will eliminate taxis, bus drivers, and truck drivers. So even more well/decently paying blue collar jobs will be eliminated by the march of progress.

We cannot stop the advancement of automation (well, we could by a concerted effort but it would just mean we would fall behind everyone else on the planet) so instead we have to change, as a society, to compensate for the changes that are happening because of automation. One option to deal with this kind of transition is something like [Basic Income](https://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome). 

Whatever we do we have to address the real issue, automation is eliminating these jobs. It's not immigration. It's not sending the jobs overseas. It's not a liberal plot. It's not ""excess regulation"". It's automation which is pushed forward at breakneck speeds by the invisible hand of capitalism.

    Henry Ford II: Walter, how are you going to get those robots to pay your union dues?

    Walter Reuther: Henry, how are you going to get them to buy your cars?

&gt;I love the whole idea of UBI, but surely there has to be a crossover where robots are producing goods which no one on benefits can afford, so where is the market which would make investing in robots a worthwhile investment?

If nobody can afford it, then they won't be made.  Economics and capitalism can still function in a world of UBI, albeit modified from its current form.",supportive,supportive
"&gt; If the need becomes pressing enough, I believe people will voluntarily contribute to help the poor through charity.

People do, but it's never enough. People don't donate enough, they don't give to the right places, and sometimes they just forget.

&gt;Humans did things like that for thousands of years, whether or not the state had some form of welfare system.

True, but it's not like everyone was clothed, fed, and housed in the paleolithic.

&gt; If the state stands aside, others will come in to fill the void.

With the combination of welfare and charity, poverty is still a massive, huge problem in the world. Taking away welfare will exacerbate this.

&gt; Probably churches mostly, which will have the added benefit of forming communities that government welfare tends to destroy. 

How does welfare destroy communities? 

&gt; The lot of the poor might actually improve if we get rid of welfare, to be quite honest.

This is a common misconception. Many, many studies on universal basic income have resulted in success.

"How it works: the private sector has created a game with money as points. A certain privileged few decide the rules of the game, which change at their whim. Economists are paid by moneyed interests to defend a badly obsolete, at best, view of money. A lot of useful idiots are indoctrinated with the faith of mainstream economics. While the useful idiots prattle on about budget constraints, financiers have figured out how to use advanced math such as linear algebra optimization techniques to generate perfectly-hedged self-financing optimal portfolios that make money no matter what happens to the economy, inflation, etc. In a crisis (i.e. a psychological panic), the Fed backstops the private financiers. We should expose the vast amount of money creation going on in the private sector, and ask why can't we use public money creation to fund basic income? ",supportive,supportive

"&gt; Very low actually. He's entering a crowded field, he's relatively unknown 

Actually, Andrew himself believes a crowded field gives him a better chance -- and just yesterday in another thread I came across this which seems to confirm his faith: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo).

And it's been remarked that both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were unknowns at this stage of their initial runs, too, FWIW!

&gt; Their existence in the race makes no sense and they're extremely weak. Like do we need kirsten gillibrand if kamala harris is in the race? We dont need two centrist dems pretending to be left wing. 

Yeah but a slight majority of white women went for Trump, and Kirsten's got the conservative roots -- I still remember her when she was making news for politically conservative reasons!  And, hey, if you were a politico, why not...NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio's still exploring a Presidential run at this point, never mind Joe Biden, as you know!  I think they all know what Andrew knows -- any one candidate's chances are mathematically better when there are more candidates!!

&gt; It is possible as a relative unknown his UBI platform could be seen as a pragmatic alternative to sanders and his green new deal. 

Much as it would break my heart in most respects, Andrew's best shot would be he and Bernie were neck and neck 'cause then the argument would be that ""hey ya better take Andrew else you gonna git The Bern and AOC after that!!!""

&gt; If i had to guess based on historical trends who will win, i would guess bernie sanders. I mean as you can tell with me discussing party alignments earlier, i think we're getting to a tipping point in our politics where things will shift significantly, and I actually notice some parallels between bernie sanders and ronald reagan. 

Wow!!!  I've not yet seen anyone predict anything...okay, good to know!  Thanks for spelling that out!!  Better Sanders or Elizabeth if not Andrew!!

Though I'd hate to be on opposite sides from our conservative, Trumpian, and even white supremacist Yang Gangers, then...!

&gt; yang is 4 years late 

LOL wut???  He could've never meant anything against Clinton...though it's an intriguing idea, hmmm...but no, I don't think he could've won against Clinton or even Trump -- though I mean I wouldn't swear on that, either....

&gt; if i am correct that sanders is gonna usher in a party realignment, i believe that yang will have another chance.

Eventually, probably around 2060, the process will repeat itself, but that's a long way out, and until then, the ideological ground will be on the left's terms.

"I've thought about this Alot and this is the best explanation I've come up with (trying to be as even handed as possible) - 

The apparent struggle to find a good man (and likewise for some men unable to find a girl they like) really boils down to deep social, societal and even civilisational problems we are having right now globally, but in particular the western world. This is what the alt-right neo-misogynists like Rollo Tomassi and the like miss, the systemic issues that are driving all this. 

Women in general want a man who ""has his shit together"". And men are aware of this. It destroys our self esteem (I am a 28 year old man myself) when we look at the life we want for ourselves and then wonder why we haven't been able to achieve that. We want to be well educated, successful, well dressed, able to take a girl out fine dining, or to events, able to persue our dreams, able to travel, have a nice home, a nice car, be well rounded compassionate person and perhaps even a good father who can provide an amazing life for his kids. However, societal/class structures are making it very difficult for us to achieve life satisfaction and self actualisation (See Maslows Hierarchy of Needs) because we are dealing with so many other pressures which I will go into. This causes stress, depression and feelings of meaningless which lead to other pathological behaviours like porn addiction, unhealthy eating, extreme promiscuity and sometimes even criminality. 

This is of course undeniably exasperated by the fact that young women in my country (the UK) have actually been shown to be outperforming men in terms of education and earnings in their 20s. Generally (extremely generally) speaking they have access to a higher status lifestyle early in their life which leads to less available options of men who they deem eligible and are a similar level of social status to them. However, we should not then jump to the conclusion that women's empowerment has ""gone to far"" or is disadvantaging men unfairly. We must remember that in later life women still drastically underperform men financially and also are the most likely to experience domestic violence or do care work/housework that is unpaid and not even included in GDP figures I might add (another big problem I won't go into). One could argue that it is actually fair that women get a ""head start"" given their responsibilities around child care etc. in later life which we don't adequately help with as a society. 

I could go into more detail on the economics driving  of this but in summary in comes down to capitalist alienation a la Karl Marx, consumerism, commodification of everything, rising inequality, lowering of social mobility and a global ruling class that are tearing apart social bonds by encouraging divide and rule culture wars (Men vs women, capitalism vs communism, young vs old). Many young people, especially in the western world feel unable to ""get ahead"" due to massive central Bank induced asset bubbles which cause rising house prices and education costs. We also live under an extractive system of ""rentier Capitalism"" in which owners of private property (including Intellectual property) skim value off the top and stifle innovation leading to less opportunities for well paid work/entrepreneurship. In addition the increasing automation driving people out of work without a proper UBI is essentially making a large portion of the population ""expendable"". Especially men and women in blue collar jobs. The commons is our societies are also being privatised ever more quickly leading to a lack of social cohesion and men and women feeling isolated, lonely. 

I could go on and on but you get the point. These issues are very deep and we ultimately need to have a discussion about a total replacement of our economic and political system before wondering why we can't find a good partner. Basically a revolution.",neutral,neutral

"All right, since deadweight loss seems quite important to you, let's talk about it! The concept here is that I have a service I want to sell, but need a minimum of $10 to make it worth my while. You will buy it if it's under $20, because that's what you have to spend. A tax or other surcharge levied on top of my minimum price (say, an additional dollar added to my price as a VAT), **OR a reduction in your willingness to spend**, will bring these two price points closer together, making it less worthwhile for buyer and for seller.

I think the challenge here is that you're very concerned with the first component of deadweight loss, and not that concerned with the second. This is relevant in the context of the Freedom Dividend, because it **directly increases disposable income for 89% of Americans**. And yes, that is already accounting for the losses they will incur due to the tax itself, and lost transfers from WIC, SNAP, TANF, etc.. That means that the only place in the economy that will actually see deadweight loss from a combination of VAT **plus UBI** is the upper end of the income ladder. In the analysis I linked, that would primarily occur for households making $500,000 a year or more.

So the question I would ask is, how much of the US economy do you think will be negatively impacted by people who make **more than half a million dollars a year** suddenly experiencing deadweight loss? Keep in mind, these households represent a fraction of the top 1% of Americans. My guess is that they won't actually change their spending habits, given that those earners have a median savings rate of over 30%, suggesting they've got quite a lot of extra cash laying about.

Some playing with the numbers found things like husbands doing less double time and wives doing more (as childcare could be covered???) or others reducing one job and moving to another/study/apprentice rates etc, but this often depends how you cut the data.

UBI in action is better seen as eliminating market distortions more than supporting income (why economists tend to like it, they hate distortions).

"Obviously different people have different ideas on what UBI should entail but as a starting point, I think it's totally fair to say that it shouldn't *start* at being enough for someone to live comfortably in most major metro cities. However, that doesn't mean it won't be incredibly helpful - either families can choose to move to locations where the dollar will go way further, or they can supplement their earnings and actually save for once. Or take a risk and find a better paying, more suitable job. Or get more training/education.

Basically, it frees them to take some risks and not let them just be slaves to a slave wage.

I don't think even when talking about UBI being enough to live off of, it's ever meant (right now) to be *comfortable*. It's meant to be a *safety net* like food stamps.

&gt;If it's not enough to live off of comfortably, then we're not really in a different situation than we are now.

&gt;And big elephant in the room: The proposal doesn't make sense. It's welfare except we give it to a ton of people who don't need welfare under the assumption that the overhead to a proper welfare system is more than the waste of the inefficiencies of the UBI.

No we don't. Add in enough progressive taxation that once you hit say median income, it's literally neutral to you to have UBI. E.g., you're marginal tax rate doesn't change if you were getting UBI *today* - if you were paid say 50k, and paid 10k in taxes, you're now getting say 60k but pay 20k in taxes. The person making 20k and paying maybe 2k in taxes, now goes to 30k and pays 4k in taxes; whereas the person making 1M and pays 400k in taxes, now makes 1.001M and pays 500k in taxes. I'm sure you can do the net math.

Hypothetical numbers of course but it doesn't mean those who don't need it actually get it, but it does mean that if you suddenly lose your 100k job, you still have 10k or whatever UBI is to help you out while you search for your next 100k job (hopefully), with a tradeoff being unemployment insurance payments aren't there instead now.",supportive,supportive

"The second article you link cites an opposing view; I think we can both agree that NAFTA's effects are not a clear cut issue. What *is* apparent is that the broader economic impact was minor, either way. You can 'consider' 4 months of job growth to be significant based on unsubstantiated claims about their replacement with minimum wage part time jobs, but the impact on GDP and overall consumer wages was minimal in the context of the US and Mexican economies. This isn't a point in NAFTA's favor: the agreement was meant to promote significant economic growth. It didn't. But that shouldn't be an indictment of all trade deals. (Plus, why are you citing trade deficits when a major impetus behind the TPP is to reduce the trade deficit?) 

When you look at wage stagnation over the past few decades, it's not due to the jobs 'lost' through NAFTA. It's due to things like an under-unionized workforce, a failure to raise the [minimum wage, lax regulation, a tax code that favors the wealthy, and chicken-shit labor protections.](http://www.epi.org/publication/causes-of-wage-stagnation/) The American proletariat has also been conditioned to accept long hours rather than fight for higher pay. Does globalization hurt workers? Yes (see link), but not nearly to the same extent as these other factors, and it's a losing battle to boot (like, since WWI).

Fretting about manufacturing job loss is a total waste of fucking time. They are being automated out, not outsourced ([we are manufacturing far more as a share of GDP than we were pre-NAFTA](http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-we-pine-for-manufacturing), but there are fewer jobs. That's a direct contradiction of the anti-NAFTA narrative). What we should be focussing on is how to (a) revitalize our workforce through things like a state-funded account for each worker to be used for vocational/work-related training, like they have in France; (b) increase labor protections and the power of the worker over Capital, also like France; and (c) figure out how to prepare for the imminent automation-induced drop in the already historically low labor-force participation rate (e.g., the establishment of a guaranteed basic income). I'm an avowed leftist, but that doesn't mean I can't recognize beneficial (albeit, very flawed) corporate machinations when I see them.

"Geo-socialism was indirectly conceived by George himself in ""The Effects of the Remedy"" Chapter in Progress and Poverty as well as the chapter ""Free Trade and Socialism"" in P or FT and also The Irish Land Question.

Natural monopolies and essential services would be nationalized or muncipalized (today this would probably include internet and healthcare) as the case may be. A living basic income would be implemented so that people could refuse  wage labor in the absence of favorable terms.

But the most important part, and the part that is an anathema to the libertarian sect of George fans, is the LVT revenue would be used on a myriad of services and institutions that libertarians want to remain private and often for profit. George mentioned everything from public libraries to gyms, to theaters to parks to universities, to well-you name it.

"&gt; people that are unemployed and have 3+ children earn more money than a lot of people with a masters degree, which is unfair and infuriating

The purpose of a UBI is to make is so everyone has enough to survive, but those who work should have more than those who do not work. No welfare cliffs, no incentives to avoid working for income.

However, for the sake of our society and the future, it is a good idea for those who care for children to receive more money than those who do not. This help fix the ""mere addition"" problem: a new child in the house increase costs, but does not increase income. You can say people shouldn't have kids unless that can afford that additional cost - but saying that doesn't stop the opposite from happening. So if you take it as a given that some people will have kids that can't afford to provide for them on their own, the best option for a better future is to make sure all kids have sufficient to survive. Nobody living on the streets and starving. Invest in society as a whole, instead of saying ""I should keep what is mind, screw the other guy.""

Is that potentially costly? Will it mean that people will take home a bit less pay than they otherwise would? Possibly, depends on how it is paid for.

"First you have to detach the idea of value creation from income.  Right now a worker is expected to create something that did not exist before.  The value of what they create is what they will be paid, minus the cost of the inputs they used.  

This holds true for almost all work.  A miner might dig up some minerals that have more value in hand than they did in the ground.  Their work created value. Now of course, they don't get paid the value of the mineral.  They first have to pay for the land (the mineral before the mining work was applied) plus all the machinery (maybe a shovel, maybe millions of dollars of equipment), plus any inherent costs they bear such as regulatory costs, transportation costs, etc.

Now this lowley miner doesn't have the resources to pay for all those costs up front.  Instead they find someone who does, and offer to spend their time digging (or operating a machine) for some specified hourly rate.  Now that miner is paying for all that overhead (plus the cost of management and thr infrastructure enabling them to do this work) as the salary they don't get in their hand.  The mining company with the resources is responsible for deciding how much of the value creation the lowley miner is responsible for (net of all the costs) and offers to pay them that.  If the miner disagrees, they can always refuse.  Now the rub is, what if all the mines and mining companies collude to suppress the share the miners are entitled for their work? That right there is where the regulation of anticompetitive behavior comes in.  

This applies to most jobs.  The wage you earn working the drive through at mcdicks is representative of the value you create by doing so.  


UBI is detaching the idea that money is made or created by creating value. It is accepting that something has fundamentally changed and there is no longer enough opportunity for all people to create value, and thus we need broad based societal welfare.

"It's weird, for every argument there's an opposite argument that's just as plausible:

Pro: not having to work to survive puts more bargaining power in the hands of workers as you can simply turn down low-paid work.  
Con: a guaranteed income for all means businesses can get away with paying people less, as it no longer needs to be enough to sustain the worker.

Pro: it will increase the standard of living for everyone and eliminate poverty in one step  
Con: your livelihood is now controlled by the government, and if they decide not increase UBI payments at least in line with inflation, it could plunge millions into dependency on unstable low-paid work, becoming nothing more than an expensive replica of the current system. Without adequate taxation it could also lead to a hyper-inflation scenario. Additionally, without adequate rent controls or affordable housing projects, most of the money will simply disappear into the pockets of private landlords.

Pro: it massively simplifies the welfare system, as every citizen gets the same amount of money.  
Con: it could leave disabled people in a worse situation - some form of means-tested benefit will still need to exist, with all the same issues as current systems.",neutral,neutral
"UBI isn't really necessary for it honestly. The number of children being raised by single parents currently is roughly 21 million. 

The cost of raising a child middle class is roughly 300k dollars. By middle I don't mean 'barely middle' either...but solidly middle. Over the course of eighteen years that's roughly 17,000 dollars rounding up per year. Now, considering that's how much it costs both parents to raise the children that means it's really 8,500 a year. That's roughly 178 billion dollars to offer enough child support to ensure kids are raised middle class in terms of costs.

Divide that out by state and that's only 3.6 billion per state rounding up. In terms of spending...it's just ridiculously cheap. Not only that but once you count the cost of chasing after/jailing parents unable to pay, the cost to the legal system working through these laws, the basic administrative costs...it really becomes a fucking joke in terms of actual costs.

I mean, it's just ludicrously easy to budget that. Consider this. Right now there are about 1.5 million people in prison...of those half have at least 1 child. Now, according to a NC study of prison systems 13% of those in prison were in prison for not paying child support. Assuming a light estimate of 10% that means 150,000 people are in prison for being unable to pay child support...want to guess how much that costs taxpayers? If you guessed around 4.5 billion you'd be correct. 93 million dollars could be saved per state by not going after guys with child support. Additionally...those people could be working jobs and paying actual taxes into the state rather than costing money coming to roughly 360ish million in lost tax revenue if they made MINIMUM WAGE. So there's another 7 million we'd be saving per state.

Now, that's only counting the inmates in purely for that...the inmates in for legit crimes...they're not paying any child support anyway! That means no matter what the remaining children of those 1.5 million aren't getting shit.

I mean, the current system is quite literally burning 100 dollar bills in order to keep themselves warm because a 10,000 dollar furnace seems expensive.

UBI, not necessary to make this work...a simple realization that the operational costs and upkeep costs of the current system outstrip the actual cost of just getting the shit done...oh...and admitting that 'support' should be capped at what it actually costs to support a child rather than the current system which declares if you were lucky enough that your mom got dicked by a rich white boy you suddenly deserve more than the woman who was raped by her drug dealer.",neutral,neutral

"TLDR, sorry;

Most of taxes go to corruption (including special subsidies etc)

Ultra wealthy pay much less taxes in comparison to their real income and assets (tons of loopholes in the law designed and used by them).

Ultra poor may not pay tax on their income or (lack of) assets but they pay a much higher tax on their consumption.

Middle class and ""wealthy"" (not really wealthy, but ""well offs"") are the largest payers, because they're the ones with a bit of fat.

You can remove most public services and they'll still tax the hell out of us because most of the money goes to the first item and you also need at least a certain amount for other basic stuff like police, roads etc.

People use social benefits as excuse to justify high taxes, but it's not the cause of this mess.

I prefer high taxes and good welfare accessible to all, including a realistic UBI that prevents people from starving, decent health care and education.

People won't stop working because they have that, they'll want nicer consumption objects, better houses etc. Yes, it may make some people lazy, because they won't be desperate starving, but tons of others that are out of the working force might join because they'd get to keep their UBI on top of whatever they make working, something that doesn't happen now.

You also get to fire all those government employees that oversee welfare programs because you'll just pay everybody the same amount, no matter what (or you can relocate those same people to work for the IRS).

Even if they lowered taxes they'd need money to fund everything, so they'll just print more.

"The ""problem"" is entirely dependent on percentage distributed productive capacity per production consumption.

I would also like to highlight that Aging disease related death will either be completely resolved or substantially reduced with full youth restored within the next 50 years, this means that not only will we in effect have ~60 Million increased population growth (40% of current), but people may well be having children in their  70s, 90s, or even 110s.   
Currently people expect to live around 80 years, and have a reproductive period around age 20-40, if people expected to live &gt;150 years with restored fertility, then they might well have a second reproductive period.

As automation gradually improves in both price and capabilities it will continue to take over a greater proportion of productivity tasks which previously were only done by human labour.

This means that the ""need"" society has for average people's labour has and will continue to drop over time.
Consequently, slowing, and eventually negative population growth will be an alleviating factor on both the economic drain of Universal Basic Income, and the Resource use globally (You didn't think giving everyone enough of an income to live on for free would reduce consumption did you?).

I'm glossing over a lot of major intricacies here but as long as the pool of automated labour grows at the same speed* as the pool of Human labour shrinks, then there will be no catastrophe, and society will gradually slink into the idyllic work-free, want-less future a lot of people here on /r/futurology fawn over.

There are however a couple of pitfalls:   
Note that above I specified '*distributed* productive capacity' The first pitfall is that the vast majority of automated labour is owned by companies (it is today), without particularly fine tuned methods of redistribution of the productive capacity, then wealth will all continue to concentrate into the hands of apologetic but legally unobliged company owners (as it is today) and the vast majority of people will be left destitute, even their labour which has been valuable throughout history, now ""too expensive"" for anyone to bother buying.   
  
In this scenario it is sort of *good* in a bad way that negative population growth means fewer people will starve to death.    
  
The second pitfall is that Universal Basic Income or a differently named system of socialist wealth redistribution which produces the same intended result is not mandated by those nations which have democratic forms of government before the process of removing political power from the vast majority of people who have little or no economic power has been completed.
If enough countries around the world implement such redistributive systems there is a good chance that the rest will follow suit.

On a personal note for Elon Musk; 
I hazard that assumption that he needs a large population pool of educated people who do not enjoy their life on earth to select from for his future Solar system colonization efforts.   
From his perspective, the  idyllic work-free, want-less society means the death of human civilisation, since the increasingly docile population will stay on earth until an eventual [unavoidable catastrophic event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk#Non-anthropogenic) snuffs out all intelligent life in the observable universe (earth).   
You might notice that he sometimes comments on UBI by saying ""people need meaning, that's the most difficult thing""

This doesn't make Elon morally wrong, but to some extent he *Needs* an overpopulated, poverty stricken earth in order to increase the likelihood of success for his (apparent) mission to save the human race.

*If automated labour grows faster than human labour shrinks then the productivity of the economy (Supply) will continue to grow but the consumption Need (Demand) will cap out at the limits of reasonable need for a human being and eventually shrink. When *Weird Things* Begin to happen with production capacity because of this, then we will need to make society wide efforts to increase the number of humans. I am optimistic that by that time, somewhere between 2050 and 2100 technological progress in cloning, artificial wombs, male pregnancy etc. will have made it trivial to repopulate the earth rapidly if needed.",neutral,neutral

"I find your second paragraph contradictory...wouldn't a basic income provide more control of the economy to the people? I mean it quite literally is ""give people money to spend on what they choose.""

One of the main points is that lower skilled jobs no longer take advantage of a captive labor market. All the suggestions of learning a skill or becoming marketable take time that, I assume, a low wage worker simply does not have. Having that kind of bargaining power would be enormous. Think if every single employee always mentioned in these Walmart strikes, instead of saying ""we want better wages!"" simply said ""we quit."" And with basic income they could. Assuming they're even slightly financially responsible, they have food, housing, and the rest of their needs taken care of. Quitting an exploitative job becomes a legitimate option.

"&gt; Or you can invest in a car (buying it, repairing it, insuring it, gas costs, etc.), spend 30-40 hours driving to work, working, and driving home, have the stress of bosses and performance evaluations and customers complaining, all for a net gain of maybe 50% income?

The idea is that, with an UBI, people will actually have to treat employees like human beings, rather than indentured servants. You won't likely have to deal with shitty bosses, as the likelihood of them being able to maintain a workforce will be greatly reduced when people don't have to put up with their shit. So either they end up becoming a better person and change to accommodate the newfound freedom of the employee to not be bound to filling a role to survive, or they pay more to keep people around to deal with their shit. In other words, working should be 'easier', because it would likely become less stressful or more lucrative. So even if you really don't make all that much more (if any), you'd at least have the freedom to avoid bad places to work.

&gt;It's all speculative at this point, but it seems like a UBI will have similar effects to minimum wage increases, which have correlated with inflation across the board, historically.

The estimates suggest that a UBI would more likely only increase the price of moderate priced goods, or luxury goods, because people will have more expendable cash. Staple goods would probably not increase very much, and eventually things like supply chains will work out how to better balance and distribute things like milk/bread/eggs/etc to better handle people's newfound ability to fully purchase basics.

Sure they're means-tested, but they also prevent negligent use *and* adjust better to cost-of-living than most UBI plans.  80% of the poor or more would be forced to drop those things for the UBI, many without actually seeing any improvement.

In some areas, though, Yang's version of the UBI would *really* hurt the poor.  I live in one of those areas and have known a LOT of people in the category of being harmed by the VAT while seeing zero UBI benefit.  They'd be in the 20%-ish of poor people who simply could not financially justify accepting the UBI... I understand making the entire country a better place at the expense of a few edge-case situations... but it's different when those edge-case situations are my community, and the places that already have the highest occurrences of homelessness in the country.

To put it this way... the rural poor in ""flyover"" states would be the *most* helped by a UBI.  They would literally as well as I or any other middle-class American, with zero financial fears.  That's great for them, but they *also* have the lowest occurrence of homelessness and higher ""worst case"" quality of life than urban poor in high-density states.  Then you look to the high density states, and that's where all your ""had to opt out of the UBI"" folks will be.

I absolutely see a value, even for the urban poor, in having a non-means-tested solution.  I'm in this sub because I believe in UBI in general.  I just don't believe in *Yang's* version.  It's not the first version that was popular here.  I don't even think it's the worst (a while back there was a big push for what amounted to ""take money from the middle-class to give the rural poor"").  I just don't think it represents a policy I can stand behind.  And it sucks to bring up the political side... but it's a UBI plan that progressives can't stand behind, or social democrats, or labor.  In fact, Yang tried to push this UBI through a party whose constituents either disagree with it ideologically or who would be personally affected by it.  

I'm not convinced that it would be impossible to implement a UBI that expands overall welfare *and* foots the bill intelligently.  Yeah I'll admit I'm not *married* to UBI like some people are... which is why I won't support a UBI plan that would hurt people around me.

Secondly, there would be no economic incentive to sanction, which harms the common people across the world.

In convincing people of the power of markets I try to explain that markets are not a creation of the state per se, but are better thought of as a force of nature. Even the most oppressive regime in the world that maintains an almost entirely command economy, DPRK, has black markets that work to distribute goods efficiently while also naturally pricing in the risk that black market merchants take on. The government allows it (to an extent) because they're necessary.

So to the anti-market absolutists, I try to redirect them to better questions. How are markets failing? Is this industry a natural monopoly? Is the government well positioned to do this *better* (maybe the market is failing but the government might fail as well)? Is a market fix better than a replacement? And ultimately, are your problems with markets actually problems with tax structuring and the weakness of the welfare state?

"I was suggesting the wealth tax and progressive sales tax as options to address your two reasons for defending a progressive income tax (marginal utility and capital rent), the latter of which I took to be in reference to wealth consolidating among the wealthy.  

I agree that most people wouldn't drop out of the work force if given a basic income, although when faced with an 80% effective tax rate I can't imagine it not affecting behavior in the margins.  That would be about where the top marginal rate had been in the USA during the middle of the century, arguably contributing to a more egalitarian split of the gains from economic growth than what would occur after Reagan.  I'm not convinced that anyone should have to pay that high of a marginal rate, although if you were to crunch the numbers using current tax rates rather than your initial napkin numbers it wouldn't be quite that high (20-30% combined federal and provincial for incomes of under/over $40-45k taxable income) even without lowering the BI Recovery Rate.

If you were to put the top marginal rate at about 50%, you could effectively structure your system the same as a BIG/FIT by having the combined Federal, Provincial and BI Recovery Rates total 50% at all incomes but with different breakdowns throughout the income spectrum.  The big difference with your proposal compared with what I've been suggesting would be to keep the basic deduction, the original intent of which was to not tax the moneys needed for basic necessities. To me, the Basic Deduction becomes redundant with a Basic Income.

I haven't seen any study besides the ones done in the states during the Nixon era that suggests that a UBI would lead to significant numbers of people dropping out of the workforce, although iirc that was more to do with it leading to people seeking divorce.  They also lacked a control group, not to mention the welfare state at the time doing its part to break up families as the mother and child would be denied aid if there was an able bodied male living with them.

I think that the goal should be to make it easier for the average person to accumulate wealth and to not make it more difficult than necessary for them to do so than to make it easier for the very wealthy to accumulate an ever growing share of the wealth and capital in the world.  I think that a progressive income tax is a pretty darn imperfect method of tackling income/wealth inequality, and income inequality isn't all that extreme in Canada to begin with anyway.

A wealth tax would be admittedly tricky to implement, but I'm pretty sure that a progressive sales tax wouldn't be that difficult to do.  You could keep admin costs in check by tracking purchases over $500 or $1,000 dollars or something like that, similar to how the IRS tracks purchases over $10,000 in order to tip them off to potential income tax fraud.

Anyways, [I'll link the spreadsheet I made up quite some time ago for a BIG/FIT](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-e2cAfkIZ-ZnupMIXcQWYZyOWgKG0O2cqi-mXKFyUbA/edit?usp=sharing) and how that would look.  The effective tax rate drops off as it approaches whatever you set the Flat Income Tax at, with the ETR going negative for those below the break even point.  This latter point is why I was kind of scratching my head over your objection to an NIT since they are (or at least can be designed to be) effectively the same thing, which is how they're apparently designing this pilot program.",neutral,neutral

"I am curious, why do you think that the United States continued to dominate the world economy while the U.S.S.R. went on to go bankrupt?

I think most people would argue that it was caused by corruption, but if you have other theories, I would love to hear it.

I content that corruption is inherent in all governments, and while it can be disastrous, it's more disastrous to economies with a government monopoly. Further, I think non-nationalist states who care little for their government and the continuation of their government and culture will have less passion to work hard to continue their society. I believe that the U.S.S.R. suffered much more harshly, when compared to the U.S. in having people who simply were not passionate about their nation and society. I would back this up with the question, do you think those who are passionate about their job work harder than those who dislike their job?

I believe that we need to work hard for our communities, families, and country, not just for our bosses. When I look around and see friends who are content to do the bare minimum, and who don't really love their work, they tend to stagnate. This mentality is what I believe drove the U.S.S.R. to bankruptcy, as lack of passion and desire to strive for hard work to hold up society caused a lack of innovation... it got to a point where the U.S.S.R. was blocking information about the U.S. because people in the U.S.S.R. were learning that everything Americans had was better than what they had, they knew their system was falling behind, and it caused the system to collapse.

Contrast this with China, who you would think would suffer the same fate, but did not because it is homogeneous, and the people are trained to work hard for China and honor their state, friends, and families. China is also not at all Marxist, people will still starve if they don't do what the government dictates in China.

The point of that is simply that I just don't believe that we will be able to give people the right of others people's work and it will fix anything. If people in the U.S. do not like the U.S., then the U.S. can, and will, fall.

I think that a guaranteed basic income will be yet another nail in the coffin, which was made when we implemented the worst policy in the history of democracy, ""Social Security"".

And finally, let me be clear, I want people to be able to succeed, I acknowledge that America has a lot of problems. I just don't agree that UBI will fix those problems. I think UBI is an idea that comes from good hearted individuals, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I also think it's become somewhat  faith based in it's promotion. I see people unwilling to look at other methods of change, only willing to conform to a new ideology, again based on faith.

"Yang proposes funding UBI via VAT increases, which is largely criticised as one of the most regressive forms of taxation. Yang addresses this very issue by saying ""Because the VAT is funding a UBI for the poorest Americans its not regressive""


Personally I have two issues with this, firstly he seems to be once again another Democrat who is afraid to substantially tax either the rich or corporations, the thing is in an automated future, it is the rich and corporations who will be receiving increased profits, so naturally it seems to me that is where taxes should get more funding from.

Secondly you can only tax the middle class to fund a UBI for the poor, if the middle class have jobs, one of the main ideas behind UBI is that automation will decimate jobs not just for the poor but for middle and upper class jobs.

In such a future, the only place tax income is going to come from is from the rich/corporations who own the robots/ai. His plan to tax the middle class is effectively a short term plan only, that doesn't really work in the long run. Further he is effectively asking them middle class to accept lower living standards (increasing costs of good they buy due to vat while their salaries stagnate) to pay for UBI for those poorer than them, while companies are given free reign to increase their profits by automating away jobs.",against,against

But how do you solve the incel problem?  Just as the elimination of artificial trade barriers resulted in economic inequality, the elimination of artificial social barriers (e.g. divorce laws, miscegenation laws, prohibition of gay marriage, etc.) has resulted in a chunk of the population alone with little or no hope of finding a spouse/partner.  Under the old social structures, any one who wanted to get married got married because there were limits on who you could marry and once you were married it was permanent. (e.g. Asian women had to marry Asian men; Black men had to marry black women.  Once you were married you had to stay married to the same partner.  ""Chads"" couldn't go from partner to partner to partner taking away potential wives from incels.)  It was socially unacceptable to stay single (unless you were a priest or monk).  So what do we do?  Bring all these old laws back?  It's hard to see a way to solve the incel problem without taking back people's freedom and right to choose whoever they want to be with.

"I'll paste my reply to Pm-your-tounges where I covered most of the same issues. 

""Most consumption models economist's advocate have built in mechanisms to take the burden off the poor and middle income earners. For instance a lot of consumption models either exempt tax on the first $10-30,000 or provide rebates to compensate the more vulnerable income groups. In general economists support consumption taxes over income because they're less discriminating towards wealth and more pro market. Though they aren't exactly politically popular, so many economists compromise with middle ground proposals. As Gordon mentioned in his blog

""The optimal tax mix is heavy on consumption taxes, light on corporate taxes, and somewhere in between on personal income taxes."" "" 


""For instance if we take a basic income model (let's go with Milton Friedman's Negative Income Tax) and use it as a replacement for the existing welfare state outside of health and education, It does more to take care of the poorest third of the population than the existing welfare state does at a lower cost.

Using Friedman's numbers adjusted for inflation and the USD to CAD conversion rates a NIT would have the tax threshold at $41,000 USD or $56,000 CAD. Anyone below the threshold pays no income tax and receives money from the government relative to their income level on a monthly basis. For example

Someone who earns no income would receive $28,000 CAD annually.

Someone who earns $33,000 would receive $10,000

Someone who earns $40,000 would receive $6,700

Someone who earns 47,000 would receive $3,300

Someone who earns 54,000 would receive slightly less than $1,700

Someone who just hits the $56,000 threshold or is slightly below it would receive no money from the government and pay no tax.

Everyone who earns over $56,000 is a taxpayer.

Under Friedman's NIT, taxpayers would pay a flat 25%. Since a flat tax is electorally unpopular among Canadians, a more pragmatic solution would be a 25-28% federal/provincial rate for anyone earning between $56,000-120,000 CAD and a 30-35% rate for anyone earning 120,000 or more.

So ideally under this model, the federal government would look like this.

Taxes:

12% income tax rate for people earning between $56,000 to 120,000 CAD and a higher rate of 15% for $120,000 or over.

A 5 to 7.5% GST Rate

A $50-75 per tonne fee and dividend style carbon tax on the federal level

Federal Spending as a Percentage of GDP:

8-10% under the new basic income scheme

3% on Infrastructure

2-2.5% on the military (maybe 3% if we want higher pay for servicemen)

1-2% to cover a small share of provincial health and education transfers.

Total Federal Spending = 14-17% of GDP

The Provincial model would like like this

Taxes:

13-16% income tax rate on anyone earning between $56,000-120,000 CAD and 15-20% on anyone earning over $120,000

A 5 to 7.5% PST rate

A $50-$75 per tonne fee and dividend style carbon tax on the provincial level.

Provincial Spending as a Percentage of GDP:

11% on Healthcare

4.5-5% on Education

Total Provincial Spending: 14.5-16% of GDP  "" 

This would put total government spending somewhere between 28.5% of GDP to 33.5%, which would be a total reduction in government spending between 7.5%-12.5%. GST and The Fee and dividend modeled carbon taxes would be effective at providing rebates/compensation to lower and middle income earners so that they're not being shafted by the system. Not to mention that under a NIT, there would be a $28,000 income floor for the poorest citizens (not to mention that GST/PST rebates might leave them with slightly more money as well).  

Under this system, All Canadians of all income levels would pay less tax. The money going into the welfare state would more effectively cover the poorest third of the population and the government would need to spend less money in general to keep it all running. 


Though even if we don't overhaul the system and abolish the corporate tax rate, revenue wouldn't be an issue as long as spending was kept sustainable. Spending 37.5%-39% of our GDP under the current system instead of 41-44% would be enough to run steady balanced budgets outside of a recession. Not to mention that carbon taxes would already cover up the cost abolishing corporate taxes would cause in the long term. ",neutral,neutral

"&gt; The people that give that money to others clearly do think that the content is worth more to them than the media... and the people that don't, don't... not seeing any clear diminishing of maximum utility in there

If someone spends money on 2005 media then they are reflecting that that media is more important than the opportunity to spend that money elsewhere. But that doesn't mean they wouldn't rather have both the media and that money to spend on something else. Because when that person spends that money on something else they become even MORE happy. If the money goes to the copyright holders and those copyright holders are richer the person buying (which they almost always are), and he would have created that work despite a copyright only lasting 10 years, then utility will have been diminished, by definition. Because each dollar you make generate less utility than the last, on average, per the law of diminishing marginal utility.

 &gt; Their purchase (like any other voluntary transaction) creates value.

No, it doesn't. Transferring money does not CREATE value, it transfers it. Labor, and the skillful application thereof, creates value.

 &gt; The true tragedy of reduced utility would be if the media was not created in the first place because the creator had to be a barber to make ends meet.

And long copyright does nothing or almost nothing to enable that because the vast majority of money generated by intellectual property of media is made relatively close to its publication. But I agree, it is a tragedy that many potential creators are forced by necessity to work at a job with a salary to ensure income. This is why I am for things like a larger endowment for the arts, and a universal basic income, to give potential creators the resources they need to actually create the art they want to. A longer copyright doesn't actually do this. Because no aspiring author was ever thinking, when the copyright was 15 years: ""Damn, I would write a book, but in 15 years the amount of royalties I receive will go way down or disappear from the year before, when they were just pennies a month, I'm definitely not going to write that book now.""",supportive,supportive

"&gt;I think that's why it's important to call it ""universal"" basic income. That word really does imply no stipulations. The idea is that just by being a living citizen you deserve a basic standard of living. And then those with further gifts and contributions can achieve more but you won't need ambition to survive. I do think some people are going to perhaps let themselves fade into doing nothing at all, because they can, but honestly? Those people are just doing a slightly removed version of that now. Why not let them cut out the middle man and just spend all of their time doing nothing? And maybe if we don't have such pressure on us to just even have a basic existence, maybe just maybe doing nothing will be less attractive.  

Same reason why we make 15 year old students who are terrible students go to school. It keeps them busy.

&gt; the idea of universal health care is a noble one, one which is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain due to overpopulation and ever increasing aging population.  

I agree , those are definitely important factors. One other factor is largely the lack of cost reducing innovations in healthcare. Even when we're talking about medical tech, the price usually goes up,(by a lot) , not down , unlike regular tech markets. Another is the structure of regulation in healthcare , which is definitely needed , but is a serious barrier to cost reducing innovation. And of course there's also the impact of people in healthcare organizations , who like in many other organizations , block some innovations that threaten them in some way. 

And those factors also make it hard for quality increasing innovations to enter the market, which is a real shame

"&gt; believing everyone who doesn’t do it your way is a loser 

I don't think this. People can do whatever they like. What I am saying is people have options to succeed in life rather than expecting the government to intervene.

&gt; Except I don’t think people should just sit back and wait for government aid, but I also don’t think it’s solely up to you whether you succeed. 

I agree with this. It's not solely up to you; you have to find opportunity in markets/industries that are growing or are in demand. Obviously if the entire economy falls apart its going to be more difficult, but there are always options, and every big change in the economy will also open doors. For example, retail jobs are in dire straits until the rona is over, but ecommerce opportunities are booming because people are buying shit online like crazy.

Look, I'm not trying to speak in absolutes here. I am a classical liberal to a large degree but I'm not going to sit here and argue that socializing certain things is bad. I have no problem with primary education, fire depts, etc. Hell, if we did not have farm subsidies we would not have farmers... or food. I also don't want to do shit like eliminate the EPA or FDA, as inept as both of them are. 

What I am saying is that people always have opportunities to start careers or learn skills that are in demand. I wasn't given any opportunities that anyone else doesn't have. No one dropped a career on my lap- I made it happen while I was working in food service. People have the power to change their situation RIGHT NOW instead of waiting for the government to manipulate industries or increasing min wage which would just cause inflation and the elimination of jobs and small biz.

Now, where I think you and I can find some common ground is that I think instead of pushing kids into college we should be pushing them into trades and skills like coding or ecommerce. I am much more interested in giving people the tools to learn how to succeed outside of the dying college -&gt; career trajectory, and if the government wants to put money into that instead of bloated public colleges or UBI or entitlements I am all for it.

&gt;It's not really difficault to work out that if communists and terrorists are backing someone then it's probably a bad bet. They're backing him because it serves their cause not ours.

Communists are such a small demographic almost anywhere in the world I don't think I need to worry about those with Stalinist inclinations. As for terrorists, well they're everywhere. And the definition shifts with perspective. I don't condone terrorism. But I understand how it manifests and that is not in a vaccuum. Terrorism is created. The answer is to change the environment that people live in so that they have a basic level of care, income, sustainability and freedom. Lofty? Sure. But admirable.

That's Corbyn's view. To create a world were people don't have to resort to violent, terrorist tactics. They're free, healthy and not starving. They've a community and a place in it. It may be naive, but it is noble.

"I had been slightly curious myself, so I looked into this.  This is my brief conclusion of what MMT is:

MMT is a way of looking at Government issued Currency and Government Debt in a way that matches up with reality, rather than the way a lot of us think of Government issued Currency and Government Debt.  A lot of us have wrong perceptions about these economic subjects of study, much of it caused by the sales and marketing that is Neo-Classical economics, and these wrong perceptions being so pervasive throughout our media, and our culture.  MMT proponents are trying to dispel these wrong perceptions that a lot of us have about Government issued Currency and Debt.

There are a multitude of government programs we could create, using the power of government, to help all of us that are struggling financially right now.  We could ensure everyone of us a home, food, health care, education, and employment/basic income.  Once enough of us realize this is the truth, it will be more difficult for those ""in charge"" to get us to believe otherwise. 

From more of Marx/Dialectical Cosmic viewpoint, MMT isn't going to save the capitalist system from it's inevitable collapse (there's too many counter-forces coming right at it, some immensely good, some more non-comfortable), but it can help us dispel wrong perceptions about Government Currency and Debt, and can help lead our collective selves to a place where we can more clearly see how to ease some of our suffering, until capitalism has finally passed.

Here's a link to a series of good videos exploring MMT more in depth:

[https://www.youtube.com/user/ModMonPubPurpose/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/ModMonPubPurpose/videos)

I felt the first one was a good one to get started on, especially because of the talk by Michael Hudson on the History of Currency and Debt:

C) Taking race out of the equation, there are plenty of people in the US that are against Free Speech in the US. SJWs, man. Even still, that's a very small minority with very little influence.

D) Educating an individual and showing them how great this country is more effective, if we're expressing opinion here. Showing them and their children that we're tolerant and respectable people is more effective than sending them back with their shit in their hands, if anything, that's going to make them even more pissed off. If we're good to them, we become less of a target. The problem is, this country isn't that great, and we're facing a bleak future of automation, unemployment, and eventually violence. Corporations aren't going to pay for basic income if our jobs are replaced. We've created a perpetual war in the middle east that I'm not sure we want to end. Terrorism works because of the distribution of fear.

E) Be vigilant. You're not safe regardless of who you're around. 100,000 people coming in isn't your problem, the guy down the street that has been struggling his entire life might be though.

F) I don't expect some man to fix my problems, I'll fix my own problems. One single person doesn't know what's right for everyone. I'll explore and learn other people's views, but I'll never idolize them.

"With regards to the economic system, do you propose people are paid based on the effort they put in, rather than the value they create? Because tbh that’s largely what our employment situation is, people are paid basically for their costs, plus or minus $50k (90% of people fall within the $30-130k range). Both situations are essentially indentured servitude, even if the clothes are nicer at the top of that range... there is 40 years of hard labor before a rest.

Billionaires live outside that realm of getting paid to cover your costs, they get paid based on value captured, which can either be from wealth created or wealth taken (think gamblers vs carpenters). The PC create a lot of wealth through massive improvements in productivity. Coca Cola imo are largely takers of wealth, they provide a brief bit of happiness one could argue, but I hate soda and what it does to people and people are happily departing with their money for nothing of real value.

The real issue to me are the takers. This includes financial industries, superfluous jobs, and people who’s job it is to transfer money from one person to another. The makers are people who build things, systems, tools, are actually providing solutions when they do sales. These things valuable to society and should be appreciated

To what extent is a different story, should a billionaire have as much as they do? Well, it’s hard to place a limit on things, and capital tends to accumulate which is both a blessing and a curse, it’s given us the whole quality of life improvements seen over the last 500 years. It absolutely has not given us the poverty and suffering we have today, that came standard, long before any of this.

The idea of everyone needing a job is crazy to me. It gets crazier when I open a position and start hiring. I don’t want someone to be forced to take a job at Evil Company because they need to feed their kids.

We should universal basic income, income should be taxed at higher rates for higher earners. Inherited wealth is crazy to me, so I love an estate tax in almost every situation except for someone having to sell their parents business to pay the tax bill :(.

Tuition costs are outrageous, student debt not being dischargeable in bankruptcy is a fucking atrocity. Take care of student debt and tuition, give us free healthcare, and provide a basic UBI to give employees some leverage in hiring negotiations, tax the rich a fair bit more and get rid of loopholes. That’s all great and reasonable.

But it’s still the same system, and that will be okay because the system we have actually does a lot of work for us quite well, it’s just hard to remember that iPhones and trains and airplanes and everything aren’t normal at all, we’ve gotta build stuff, and capitalism allows that to happen like no other system.

"How the hell does basic income increase the ""welfare trap""? Do you know what the welfare trap is? I linked you the Wikipedia article, but in case you didn't read it, it's how our current welfare system  often disincentives working because the loss in welfare benefits can be greater than or equal to the income they'd receive from working. If you're making $1,500/month in welfare and a job at McDonald's pays $1,500, there's no reason to take that job. Basic income remedies this by indiscriminately providing for everyone regardless of how much money they're making.

Now that I read the rest of your post, I don't even think you know what basic income is. Welfare is not basic income. A welfare recipient is not receiving a ""basic income"". Basic income is a system-wide transformation where every citizen indiscriminately receives the sum of money.

If you have a better alternative than basic income to combatting the mass chaos that would ensue in a society of 80% unemployment due to technological automation, I'm all ears.

The worst part is that it doesn't have to be this way.  Like you said, your job is extremely inefficient.  They probably don't *actually* need someone there to do it, they could just as easily task another staff member with handling emergencies as they come up along with their regular duties.  So many people work pointless nothing-jobs because ""that's just the way it is"", you gotta work to survive and survive to work and anything else makes you a drain on society.  But it's only like this because we decided it has to be like this.  We could just as easily decide that 20 hours should be a full work week for a livable wage, or to give everyone a universal basic income so they only work if they need/want to work, or a million other ways to make it so that you don't have to dedicate your entire life to work just to feed your family.

We mock the starving artist who quits his job to be in a band, but if he hits it big then suddenly we all love him and his story is an inspirational tale of following your dreams no matter what.  It's like there's this glass ceiling that's three feet thick, and you have to chisel your way through it one tiny chip at a time whenever you get the chance to climb up there and do it, and the one guy who managed to get lucky and find a weak point to burst his way through gets held up as an example of how anyone can do it if they just try hard enough!  But not you, god, don't you know that shit's 3 feet thick?  You'll never make it through there, just stop wasting your time and get back to work already.  There's zero self-awareness of the paradox here, and when I try to talk to most people about it there's just this complete mental block of being able to wrap their heads around the idea that the axiom doesn't have to be what we made it.

And even if it's not a matter of not being able to make money as an artist, even if it's just ""man I'd rather be fishing right now,"" why is that so bad?  Why is it wrong for people to want to live the lives that fulfill them?  Why is self-enrichment not more valuable than generating profits for someone else?  Why should you have to wait 65+ years until you can retire - if you can even afford to - to finally be able to spend your life the way you wanted to spend it all along?

&gt; It might lead one to believe, from a paranoid Hegelian perspective that this is deliberate to keep the arts suppressed and from transforming the whole of society in a way that is untenable to the powers that be.

Frankly, I think that's exactly the answer to my last paragraph.  Anything that doesn't generate profits, anything that makes people question their place as a cog in the machine, anything that would endanger the precariously balanced system in any way must be suppressed.

"Maybe you should of read the article before proclaiming people to be ridiculous.

Basic income is not for everyone. Anyone who is not working or can't work. Unlike welfare or unemployment insurance that ends after so long or only applies in specific conditions basic income means people put of work at the time.

Regardless as the article suggests and says 10% are unemployed. It does add confusion when it says 23% of youths are unemployed. This simply means of the total population including youths it's 10 percent. Of just youths it's 23%.

So 500,000 people need basic income. Not 5.5 million. Even at 1000 a month that equals 6 billion a year.

Moreover you used some shady tactics to get your 54 bill estimate. First you showed 14 and up is 83% of the population then instead of calculating cost at 4.5 mill you calculated it at 5.5 roughly.

So that's actually 450,000 people or around 5 billion.

This would hypothetically work if A.I. meets our expectations, but we're still in the early stages of the ubiquitous A.I. roll-out and it's possible that UBI (under a capital gains tax) wouldn't realistically manifest until after Yang's terms were up anyway. That said, the trajectory toward that A.I. roll-out is often a result of fiscal conservation during recessions and downturns. Ideally, as these downturns happen and companies up-skill their labor force (causing laborers without new training to lose out to newer competitors), they invest in A.I. that protects their overhead and increases their capital. That increased capital may be enough to get taxed for UBI.

The problem with all these arguments over UBI is that it relies on A.I. to produce enough goods that can be bought cheaply, or at least exported to other nations, by populations who can afford those goods. AFAIK, we don't have a large enough automated workforce to meet the capital needs of UBI. We may get closer with each recession/downturn, but then we usually get more mouths to feed too.

I don't know if any of this would ""tank"" the economy, but the fear is over secular stagnation and a market that stalls out for a long rather than drops out and slowly rebuilds.",neutral,neutral

"&gt;The article doesn't contain the word 'emergency'.

It embeds a facebook post that Dalio made, ala:

&gt;I got a good question about how the proliferation of AI and algorithmic decision making will affect jobs and about the possibility of universal basic incomes eventually impacting humans’ ability to continue to derive meaning and self-purpose from work. My view is that algorithmic/automated decision making is a two edged sword that is improving total productivity but is also eliminating jobs, leading to big wealth and opportunity gaps and populism, and creating a national emergency. Largely as a result of it, capitalism is not working for the majority of Americans and is in jeopardy. Yet no one is seriously examining what to do about it.

&gt;I don’t believe that transferring money to people who are unproductive is good for the people or the economy, unless there are no other good alternatives. I believe that it’s both far better and it’s possible to find ways for making most of these people productive. **I think that a national emergency should be declared**, a special commission created, and metrics established to come up with programs and measurements to make work improvements that more than pay for themselves and measure the changes that are taking place. I know of many cost effective ways that improvements that pay for themselves can be made and I’m sure that many others know of many more ways.

&gt;Productivity is good for everyone. Unfortunately, it’s not available to everyone. That has to change. We need leadership that can bring that about. Unfortunately, it is more likely that nothing along these lines will be done and, in the next economic downturn, the haves and have nots will be at each other’s’ throats, fighting over income redistributions rather than working together to make plans to make most people productive. For that reason, I’m worried about the health of capitalism and democracy.

I agree with you totally on this:

&gt;In any case, the idea that automation is the 'emergency' (short of an actual Skynet-like robot rebellion) is completely misleading.

“If the goal is to have everyone employed digging trenches, why not give them spoons instead of shovels? 

A jobs guarantee isn’t a poor idea in itself, but I really think a UBI is necessary to ensure the people working it are doing so because they’re interested in additional income, not because they have to. 

&gt;Fourth, how are companies going to keep up with outside countries that automate when they are taxed at such high levels?

Well, part of the argument is that UBI is necessary already because of the effect automation and globalization has had on suppressing wages.

I suppose your point about global competition in terms of tax leverage very well may be an issue- 

However, economists predict a $.8 Trillion GDP growth due to a massive increase in consumer spending. 

&gt;Thirdly, there are lots of things that are fixed. Land for housing, factories and farmland for instance. Land is already rising faster than inflation.

I was talking about high land values being the primary factor of the high cost of living under the status quo. High land values persist under LVT, yes, but the tax cannot be shifted by the landlord onto tenants. Whatever people are paying in contract rent, they are going to get back the location premium in public goods and/or a UBI.

"&gt; History says otherwise. 

The move from the farm to the factory was a move from physical labour to cognitive labour. Workers became the brains of the machines, pressing buttons and pulling levels. As technology becomes smarter, fewer workers are needed to achieve the same or higher levels of productivity.

&gt; If technology were the ultimate destroyer of jobs, why is US unemployment in 2015 lower than the average of the last 50 years? 

The US has does not hide the fact that the unemployment rate does not represent the actual number of people who are not working. The participation rate has been declining since 2000, during a time when the data also shows that 50% of older people are not able to retire and 30% of recent graduates can't find work. At the same time we have a rapid rise of low-quality, low-pay, and on-call jobs. The UK follows the same model. This trend is unsustainable.

&gt; Society needs to adapt to technology, not just give up and say ""we can't compete with technology"". Of course we can. It's not going to be painless, but of course it can be done.

His proposed EITC reform would also require careful consideration. I don't see any specification of where he proposed to put the curve. As is, EITC is basically a cash handout to people with both income and children. The more children you have the more cash you're handed. He wants to give the same handout to everybody regardless of how many children they have, or whether they have children at all...but nevertheless continue to require that they have income to get anything. And the more income they have up to a certain point, the more they get. If you make $20,000, you get handed more money than if you make $10,000.[1] Which is kind of obviously dumb, but to be fair that's not this idea. That's just how EITC works. I'm not sure why he's not proposing to eliminate it altogether. But...either way, keeping it and eliminating the number-of-children qualifier immediately prompts the question: at what level? If you're applying it at say, the 4 children level, and you're giving that now to everybody...that's a _huge_ additional expense. Even at the two children level, he's giving it to everybody...even then it might be a net cost increase because you're now handing out a large tax credit to large numbers of people with no children at all. Looking at an [EITC chart](http://www.irs.gov/publications/p596/ar02.html), I'm guessing he's probably thinking of implementing at the 1 child level.

1. Nationalism questions. Citizenship/residency rules. How resistant will people be to qualification issues. At the far-out end, is a single, eu-wide ubi part of the discussion in any way? 
2. Currency.  US is a powerful example because of the dollar. Under some interpretations of economic string theory, this gives them the power to internalize inflationary gains (eg by handing out a UBI) while distributing the costs (inflation) to dollar users (aka everyone).   
The Euro was once considered a potential dollar rival. UBI may prove to be a raison d'etre of ambitions like that. More reason to be the dollar if being the dollar enables a better UBI. 
3. Political culture. Europe generally has more of services culture. The EU has made ""governing by grant"" a little more normal... but there are political norm hurdles to cross.

But, they've kind of gone with a nordic flavoured trickle down model for spending it. Government spending increases, trickling to salaries contracts, contractor salaries, etc.   
I think there's a weird flavour of inflation going on there. They've stumbled into  some pretty unknown territory through a sort of conservatism. After some world-first levels of thought into creating and structuring the oil fund, they almost avoided thinking about what to do if/when the fund outperformed expectations by so much.   
If Norway had built even a little UBI into the initial model, I think they would have had much better results... with no shortage of funds for public services either. Either start canceling taxes and run the treasury out of oil fund dividends or (more fun and more compatible with nordic values), distribute the dividends and tax your now super-wealthy economy. Even better, use some of this wealth to make sure basic goods (especially housing) inflation doesn't happen.

"&gt;Why send human doctors at all? Why not send one robot who can do the job better? Replacing them in one country doesn't free up people in another country when they can still be replaced with automation. It doesn't change the heart of the issue. It's not a matter of not helping poor people, it's a matter of the lack of need to have a human do it.

Who is going to send it?  Who is going to set it up?  Who is going to work with the local population so they can fill in the technology gaps?  Who is going to help consult on upgrades to their external infrastructure required to run such high levels of automation?  And that's just one scenario of bringing health care to the third world.  What about advancing medical technology, bringing new treatments to market here in the US, driving innovations in automated health care?

- Universal basic income (UBI);

- Tax incentives for companies to invest in renewables &amp; energy efficiency, and divest in fossil fuels; 

- increased duty charges on products with a minimum lifetime rating under X years (I suggest 10 depending on industry): a massive part of the problem is that products are now produced as cheap and quick as possible with no thought to longevity.

- Carbon Tax factoring the full lifecycle assessment costs of all environmental impacts of every product including food.

- 91% tax rate on annual income of more than 3 million dollars with no ability to write down tax obligations ala Trump (plenty of modelling suggests a 3-5% global tax on incomes more than several millions of dollars would cover most of the costs of a Zero-Carbon energy transition).

- Increase in penalties (financial and judicial) for ecological or environmental destruction for all private citizens, Gov and commercial interests.

"I'm UBI-agnostic, slightly leaning towards it.  My fears of it have nothing to do with wealth re-distribution - something that clearly needs to occur in some way.  

Rather, I question whether it is the correct response to the problem.  I worry that it's simply a band-aid rather than a root-cause solution.  

To vastly oversimplify, increasing automation is resulting in both massive wealth inequality and long-term employment loss.  The premise behind UBI is that it will not only provide people with the safety net but also the ability to pursue new job and business creation opportunities without having to worry about losing everything.  The question is whether it will actually do so in the long run.  

We live in a world where the entry level of technical know-how to create a new business keeps climbing.  It's not like someone is going to make a competitive semiconductor fab in their garage or electric car company off UBI wages.  Of course, there will be areas where people can still start up businesses but that slice of the pie will keep getting smaller and smaller as time goes along.  Even traditional manufacturing that was the bread and butter of US homegrown innovation in years past now basically requires CNC machines and other machinery that is so far out of the hands of the regular person that it might as well be sold on the moon.  

Sure, you can talk about 3D printing and other rapid prototyping technologies but they are generally not competitive when you move past the prototype stage and scale up to production at volume.  At best, you can come up with at good idea that has to be produced through the machinery of a much larger corporation if you want to reach a mass market.  That means being stuck in a subsidiary relationship with giants that are going to milk every cent out of your profits they can and use every opportunity to simply take over the market for themselves.

And of course, there will be people who are still able to pull it off.  But my point is that it's going to be an ever shrinking portion of the population who have the knowledge, skill and connections to pull things off.  The average person is going to start finding themselves stranded, doing the equivalent of trying to hock stuff on Etsy or other gig economy crap to get by.

So, if we end up with the scenario where UBI isn't providing the promised (real) job creation, where does it leave us?  Basically, with tens of millions of people who are dependent on UBI to survive and with no real prospects for moving past that point.  That scenario really terrifies me.  

I grew up in Montana, near a lot of native American reservations.  Those are some of the most depressing and hopeless places I have ever seen.  And yes, I realize there are a million other factors in why the rezzes are terrible - racism, cultural destruction, etc.  You don't annihilate an entire set of peoples and do your best to wipe their culture out of existence and then pitch some free houses at them and expect them to suddenly be happy and thriving.  

But I don't think it's an entirely broken analogy either.  I'm worried that we'll end up with huge ghettos of people who are getting just enough money to live in economically depressed regions of the country but not enough to move up or to more expensive regions.  They'll be no jobs outside shitty service sector and gig economy work to be found.  Yes, they'll be able to afford food, a shitty apartment and the occasional movie ticket and short budget vacation every few years but is that really a life most people want to live?  Most people need to have aspirational goals to want to get out of bed in the morning.  That might be advancing in a career or providing an essential service to others or pushing the frontiers of knowledge.  If all you have to look forward to is affording food and getting high and playing video games for yet another decade, it is going to eat away at your soul.

And I say this as someone who was pushing for UBI back in the 90s.  Seriously, I saw the trends of automation and AI back then and was talking the ears off people about how we were going to face an apocalyptic scenario where large portions of the population were going to be permanently unemployable and that we needed to rethink our economic systems to deal with that eventuality.

Obviously, I've since soured on the concept of UBI for the reasons above.  I worry that UBI is simply slapping a minimal band-aid on a huge, fundamental problem with economics and our society and will not prevent the increasing formation of insurmountable class structures and inequality.  

What worries me the most though is that in 20+ years of thinking about this problem, UBI is the best solution I have been able to think of.  It's the only reason I'm even vaguely still in support of it.  There might be a better solution out there but it's going to take someone far smarter than I to think of it.",neutral,neutral

​

neoliberalism is free market capitalism with some level of government intervention in the economy and society. it aims to achieve a high standard of living for people not necessarily through raising minimum wage or giving it free via welfare/UBI, but by making everything as cheap as possible through the free market (as the free market naturally gravitates towards the cheapest/most efficient way to produce goods e.g. chinese factories).

​

whilst government intervention is not looked down on by neoliberals as it is with libertarians, they generally dont want to see it interfere with the free market - they dont like corporate welfare either. nor are neoliberals in support of austerity, they'd rather see some level of privitisation. they dont hate nor like unions, but lets be fucking honest workers in the west have way better rights than any communist fucking country has ever given its workers.

​

increasing the GDP is probably going to increase employment capacity anyway so moving the mandate of the state to raising GDP isnt that bad, and its a shallow view of neoliberalism anyway to state that.

neoliberals also often tend to be fairly progressive by the way - they're similar to the democrats in the US, without the sanders and cortez types.

"Yang addresses fears about inflation in his policy platform, stating that “Our UBI plan has minimal changes in the supply of money because it is funded by a VAT,” and also references the “4 trillion for the bank bailouts” that resulted in “no inflation.” Inflation is about money supply, but a VAT doesn’t do much to the overall supply, it just reallocates things.

"&gt;However, while with basic income many could leave, it doesn't mean they are all going to leave, especially if they will essentially get an automatic ""raise"", so to speak.

The comment I initially replied to assumed that people would leave the work force, and claimed that would be a good thing. I'm working under that assumption.

&gt;My example was held in an imaginary vacuum.

An imaginary vacuum in which no one can do anything except work for the investor, which is different from how society works in a very important way that I outlined (people that are laid off are freed up to go work on producing other goods and services that people couldn't afford before). So we can't draw any conclusions about the real world from your example.

&gt;Whether he could do more or not is not part of the example, and in the real world, if the this was applied to all companies (people being laid off because of technology) the pattern might resemble my example.

Only to the extent that there are government prohibitions on people trying to fulfill the wants and needs of others. If there are no such prohibitions, then the laid off workers are free to use their skills to make the lives of everyone else better in ways those people couldn't afford to pay for before, but can now because other goods those people buy are being produced more cheaply.

&gt;However they harm economy by doing so.

Actually they're doing the rest of society a great favor, and are doing no harm to the economy.

&gt;Thus, the money gets stuck in their accounts.

OK, and that's great for the rest of society, because fewer dollars in circulation means a drop in the price of goods and therefore the rest of society can afford to buy more goods and services with the fewer dollars that they have. If the rich people instead chose to spend that money on goods and services, the price of goods and services wouldn't go down, and other people wouldn't be able to buy more goods and services.

&gt;As in the example, the now laid off worker's wages are now flowing into the investors account (so to speak; he simply doesn't pay them anymore).

OK, and what's he doing with that money? If it's sitting in his account, that means he's not using it to buy goods and services from the former employees. If the former employees have money, they can use some of it to buy his vital goods and services and the rest to trade among themselves for the new goods and services they're creating in their newly freed up time, like better houses and clothes and food and medical care. Each time they pay the investor for his goods and services, the supply of circulating money decreases, so the amount of dollars they're willing to accept in exchange for their new goods will go down. If the investor refuses to lower his prices to deal with the smaller supply of money, or if the employees simply have no money, and the investor is a silly person and won't trade any of his vital goods for the goods they are now producing, the former employees will have no choice but to make those vital goods on their own and their standard of living will go down. The investor's quality of life will also go down as he won't be able to buy those new goods and services from the former employees. He's stuck with a pile of dollars he can't eat.

&gt;I do not mean to say they should give it for free, but I do think something must be done to reduce that pattern and help resources flow.

People don't need your help trading resources. They need you, and the government, to get out of their way.

&gt;This example was made to illustrate what would happen if all companies did the same thing.

If all companies did the same thing, and the laid-off employees were not prohibited by government from working independently, the standard of living in society would go up. Because people are not totally prohibited from working independently (i.e. starting their own businesses), quality of life has gone up dramatically, even if as you claim wages have stayed the same. The quality of goods that people can buy today is vastly higher. We can buy better food, better clothes, better technology and entertainment, better transportation, better medical care despite all government attempts to make it worse, and so on. We are undeniably far better off than we were 50 years ago, or even 20 years ago.

&gt;In an economy where half the people were laid off, the general population would have half the income, and thus half the capacity to buy goods and services. The investor's would have that other half, but it would not be spent. 

Except the half that got laid off would go work on new things that weren't being worked on before because people couldn't afford to pay for it, but can now because the price of other goods has gone down. So the laid off half would have new income, and society would be much wealthier.

&gt;There is a limit to how much someone can spend, even for rich people.

There doesn't seem to be. They choose to limit what they spend on consumer goods, but there's no limit to what they spend on investment vehicles like stocks and currencies and real properties and so forth.

&gt;No, they don't. They mean the same number of people can generate more goods, not that they can work more. Working more can end up generating more goods, but that is not the only way.

By 'do more work', I mean 'produce more goods'. As in, get more work done.

&gt;Imagine, for example, self-driving trucks.

The number of humans required to keep the same number of trucks delivering products will go down considerably, but there will still need to be humans in the operation, repairing the trucks, finding the raw materials to build and power the trucks, telling the trucks where to go, and so forth. Until there is a fully automated system that would continue to run without any human involvement, the amount of work done is dependent on the number of humans involved. It's not *solely* dependent on that, but it is dependent on that.

&gt;Productivity is becoming independent of human workforce. This is why measures like basic income should be seriously considered.

"I would just stay away from the word ""inflation"" here as it means something very specific and in UBI in general would not lead to inflation  (unless it was paid for by increasing the money supply).

What you are talking about is just  price increases on a particular set of goods (in this case due to a hypothetical rightward shift in demand for those goods).

An  increase in demand only would lead to price increases if supply stays constant. There is no reason in general to assume there wouldn't also be more of whatever good you are considering supplied (there may be some particular instances where supply can't increase along with demand( e.g. housing in San Francisco or Manhattan where supply is artificially constrained by zoning laws, but that wouldn't be true in general not even for housing).

If people have more money to spend,  we'd expect businesses expanding in order to get their hands on that money.

"&gt; Nor is your feminist agenda of disparaging MRA's.

Hah. Funny. I can genuinely avoid any and all biased designations with my point and still be attached to the enemy team somehow.

&gt;If you increase wages and decrease hours worked, who is going to foot the bill for the now higher priced goods?

More time to spend money means more money will be spent. It's why McDonald's unions in Denmark can ensure $21/hr to their employees with the food being barely more expensive. Employees would get a bigger cut of the profit, and they'd be required to work more because they'd sell more. A society where people have money to spend is a society where businesses have consistent high incomes. 

&gt;But wait, because the factory is running 10 hours less, there are now less widgets.

No, now the wealthy widget-making business is just required to hire another employee. That means more people get decent-paying jobs and the business is forced to use more of its profits toward employees rather than trickling it ""down"" to the the wealthiest people.

Besides that, productivity is *never* the problem. I guarantee the problem in most of America is lower demand because so many people no longer have casual spending money. We can't just go and fill the theaters casually all the time, because prices aren't a few dollars. They're $15+ which might save labor costs for the theater not having to fill all those cleaning roles, but it ultimately makes people care less about the culture of going out aside from rare instances. 

The supply side is wringing America dry.

&gt;Now Bob grinds away at two jobs with even less free time than before just to make ends meet.

And how do you explain people currently working 2-3 jobs or otherwise working 70+ hours a week for a fairly basic income? What you're saying is already happening. Wages are so low that people are taking up *more* jobs individually, jobs that would otherwise go to someone else and potentially give them a living wage if the company gave any fucks about the people spending their lives making them money.

"\&gt; How many people do you seriously think are just trying to milk the system while not doing anything?

I'm not really approaching it from this angle at all.  The system *should* be there to be milked.  The system *belongs to us.*  If it's not serving us, than why is it there?

There is a lot of value that human beings offer that is lost when put in the context of exchanging your time for money.  Your parents (for example) could not provide the same amount of love and support if you had to pay them to be love you.  Those who choose not to work because they're serving their families as *unpaid caregivers* of the elderly, the infirm and the young will *not* be helped by a FJG.  At best, what would a FJG do for us?  Provide government subsidized daycare and old-age retirement homes?  Provide us with work so that we can be paid to look after *other* people's children, *other* people's parents

UBI acknowledges this kind of unpaid value - the kind of value *because it is unpaid*.  Reflect on what the difference between a grassroots movement and an astroturfed movement.  You can enact a FJG to ""build a community"" or you can unconditionally pay everyone 1000 dollars a month and people will voluntarily form their own communities.

\&gt; No one will be forced to work under a jobs guarantee. 

I disagree.  I don't think a FJG would force everyone to work, and I do believe *some* would gladly choose a job from the FJG over whatever they're doing but for many a FJG would introduce a forced-work arrangement.

Consider, that the means testing around many welfare programs means that to qualify one has to be looking for a job.  The implementation of these programs are left to the state governments.  The minute a FJG passes people will be kicked off these programs because a job will suddenly be available to them - whether they actually wanted them or not.  It sounds kind of mean, but many of these state governments are very conservative and will look for any reason to kick people off of welfare and save a little money.

You say ""nobody will be forced to take these jobs"" but without a social safety net (which will effectively be gutted) no one will have a real choice but to take these jobs.

\&gt;Are you saying there are no major problems in the United States right now that could be potentially resolved by training people that sign up to be trained and paying them to fix? Or are you disputing fundamentally that a state run entity can provide any solution to any 'market' or public need? 

Well, federal job training programs generally have a [very low success rate](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/01/the-false-promises-of-worker-retraining/549398/) so I'm already skeptical.

It's not that I don't think state run entities can't be efficient.  Chinese state owned enterprises do very well in fact; however my reading of the GND and the way it's put together leads me to believe that AOC, and Bernie Sanders are not very technologically literate and appear to be taking more input from activists rather than scientists and engineers.  They also seem to have an active disdain for the very types of people who have the most experience running very large organizations that get work done.

I agree that climate change is the most critical issue of our times so I was excited to hear about the GND but the more I read about it the more I found that I actually disagree with it and now I actually don't like it.  The devil's are in the details, of course - but like I said the root cause I believe is that AOC and Sanders are taking more input from activists than engineers and scientists.

\&gt;  a Federal Jobs Guarantee would never exist under another president (as in it would immediately be scrapped) so I'm not sure what saying that addresses here 

This makes the FJG look even worse in my eyes - especially given that means-tested welfare will be effectively defunded as a result of FJG.  Also, are we to expect that the National High Speed Rail project will be planned, approved and constructed in 4 - 8 years?  What's going to happen when the project is in overtime and Bernie's political rivals come into power?

"You are right, the Permanent Fund Dividend is only a partial basic income. And while it makes a real difference in the lives of poor families, adding usually more than $4000 to the annual budget of a family of four, it is far from an unconditional minimum that meets basic needs. But when Karl Widerquist and I put together the two books on the PFD, he calculated what the dividend could be per person, annually if Alaska had not abolished its income tax right away, if it had put more of the money in the fund, if it had taxed the oil companies at something closer to the level that Norway does, if it had taxed other resources besides oil, and then split the revenue 50/50 between funding  state government and dividends. The dividends would now be $18,000 per person annually.

If the local businesses are all cooperatives and the robots we rely on are open source, then the wealth the robots create will be widely shared rather than concentrated.

Currently, most (but definitely not all) people in the poverty range income brackets definitely don't have to pay anything out of pocket to go to public college. I work part-time and go to school full time at a local community college and I actually profit a little bit from my financial aid. 

Where it gets tricky is the ""middle-class"" income earners, particularly in places where the cost of living is really high compared to national averages and the state doesn't offer very good financial aid to make up for that. It is because of this that some people will label free college plans like Elizabeth Warren's as a ""gift to the middle class"".

The people who despise those on social assistance aren't going to be any less contemptuous however thoroughly we're policed. Why should we get the permanent fraud investigation when it's shitty corporations and banks that literally crash the economy every couple years?

I mean, the current economic crash was kind of instigated by our own government, so we'll not count this one. The last major crash was 2008, and it was basically the US reaping what it sowed. We haven't allowed the kinds of games they were playing down there for years here (thanks, 90's Liberals). I'd say 10 years between major economic episodes is a good run--particularly when we didn't exactly have many options this time.

The people who despise us on social assistance fall into two camps. The ""taxes are theft"" camp, who would prefer there to be no universal health care much less no ODSP, and the people who don't know the difference between a disabled person who can't work and an Ontario Works recipient who's doing just enough that their caseworker stays off their back about finding work. It doesn't help that Ontario works is basically a gateway these days for people trying to get on ODSP. As long as ODSP and OW are basically joined at the hip, ODSP will catch hell for OW's existence. But the actual cheats are kind of a problem, because they'd still be cheats if the government decided people on ODSP were worthy of more than $1169/month. They don't do it for the money. They do it because the government owes them something, and screw everything else. These are usually the people who've never worked a day in their life, claimed the CERB anyway, then basically dared ODSP to find out. I mean, they can probably work something out with the CRA if they felt like it, and CRA can't go after their ODSP anyway unless they use the nuclear option and drain their bank account, so at that point their only potential problem will be ODSP finding out. But they don't care about that, because the government owes them.

&gt; What we need is a guaranteed annual income to standardize the depth of grinding poverty and squalor any person can sink into, because it sure doesn't help anyone and there's easily enough wealth in a rich country like Canada to keep everyone housed and fed. It'd help economic circulation a lot better too if more money was being spent on basic human needs and less on high finance gambling.

If we can't get the government to give us a halfway decent rate for ODSP, we're not going to get the government to run out with a basic income. I mean, the NDP already tried that federally with the CERB and that didn't get anywhere. But I'd also argue whatever the government is giving disabled people for high finance gambling is basically chump change at this point. I'm not going to get rich off what the government gives me, even if they let me put it in something that guarantees a return. If you've never worked a day in your life, and no one else is contributing to your RDSP for you, the maximum you'll get from the government is $20000. Good luck doing anything productive with that when you turn 60. You basically have to either be someone or know someone who can contribute to your RDSP in a way that you get both the maximum grant and the maximum bond... and even then, that's only about $90000. I guarantee, you can't get *that* financially creative. Now, factor in you need the disability tax credit to even get the RDSP, very few people actually have a disability tax credit, and even fewer than that actually have an RDSP. The government is probably paying the people at CRA who oversee that program more than they're paying actual disabled people. The only reason I have one in the first place is ODSP ignores its existence. Otherwise I'd have probably opened an RRSP instead.

1. **internally motivated**: This is the minority. They find inspiration and motivation within themselves. They are not very driven by money, prestige, power, etc and other external rewards. They are driven by a sense of internal pride, job satisfaction, quest to learn and explore, etc. These people shine in a socialist environment - poverty, lack of social standing, etc are not real road blocks and their internal drive motivates them to excel with ""common"" resources. (Work longer hours because I love the work.)

2. **externally motivated**: these are your majority of people. They care about some or all of the external rewards, and will work more and try different things if it means they can get more of the things they care about. (Work longer hours = more money, more visibility, chance at promotions). In a world of basic incomes, free Healthcare, free education, housing, and other social benefits, they are more likely than not to just chill and enjoy the benefits and do the bare minimum to ""meet the quota"" and get by.

Because majority of the people fall under category 2, and not category 1 - overall productivity drops and economy tanks. This is not sustainable unless there is massive automation supporting the economy such that the work of the minority in category 1 can keep the whole majority sustained. 

Even then, the majority in Category 2 start feeling entitled to the benefits while at the same time driven to slave labor for quotas. And people in category 1 gradually lose motivation from their work being used to satisfy the selfish ingrates in category 2. Results in unrest and chaos.",neutral,neutral

* all the tax that people aren't paying because they're currently not paying the top tax rate
* a large portion of social assistance payments to disadvantaged people (a lot of social assistance can be replaced by the UBI)

"&gt;Also how do u convince the rich to stay rich?

Doing anything to earn money might be a choice, but high-paying jobs and large estates of assets existing is not.

If some of the rich decide to quit their jobs because they feel it's not worth it when they don't get to keep as much money (unlikely, because we aren't talking a very big increase in taxes- most of the money being given out in UBI and Wage-Subsidies would have been money the poor would gave been receiving anyways under a high Minimum Wage and what little remains of the welfare system...  Top salaries go up from having to pay workers less, but tax obligations go up about the same amount...) then someone else (perhaps even someone harder-working from a less privileged background) will just take the job they held.  There are people lining up out the door to work hard and make big money...

If today a company pays 6 US workers $10/hr and 6 Chinese workers for $5/hr, and makes $200/hr in revenue off their labor, $90 of which goes to worker wages, and $100/hr of which goes to executive compensation for one of the company bigwigs, with the remaining $10/hr as stockholder dividends (these numbers aren't even as bad as real life: exec's typically make more than 30 times bottom-tier US workers...)

Under my plan:

The same company would be constrained by no Minimum Wage, so might pay 12 US workers (many of them resettled Latino migrants and refugees) $3.50/hr, and an executive $138 hr, with the remaining $20/hr as stockholder dividends.

However Income Taxes on the executives might go up an additional $67/hr, and Capital Gains taxes on the stockholders the equivalent of an extra $10/hr (Note that Capital Gains went up a bit more proportionally than Income Taxes on executives- because right now we place too much tax burden on high-earners and too little on wealthy Trust Fund babies who do nothing but collect a dividend each month...)

Wage-Subsidies might then provide an extra $3.50/hr on all of those paychecks (1:1 matching for the workers!) including that of the executive, and everyone receive $5k a year in Universal Basic Income (the equivalent of everyone getting an extra $2.50/hr, including the executive).

This leaves a slight ($154/yr per person) shortfall, which might be funded through small increases on Income Taxes on the workers (so the tax-hikes seem more ""fair"" to the executives), on the Middle Class in excess of their UBI and Wage-Subsidies (a couple of those who were ""workers"" in the first scenario might now be Middle Class in the 2nd, their superior socioeconomic status supported by the new migrants and now-larger domestic economy), or my favorite: raising the Gas Tax so we no longer subsidize automobiles so much.

Alternatively (and quite likely given how politicians do business), we might run an extra $2002/year ($154/person) in debt in the latter scenario.  Which seems like a bad idea until you realize that domestic production would go up by $200k/year (half of the $100k/yr being produced before was produced overseas by Chinese workers), domestic pre-tax revenues by $60k/yr (what was being paid to Chinese workers), and tax revenue would increase $154k/yr.  So by any measure, an extra $2k/yr in debt would be manageable: likely the nation's deficit:GDP ratio would improve, and the existing debt become more manageable.

As an astute observer, you might also notice that, after Wage-Subsidies and Universal Basic Income, the US workers were still making $0.50 less an hour than before ($1k/yr).  This is based on the simplifying assumptions that they are all equally skilled (likely, some workers would make less than $3.50/hr, some more), working an equal number of hours (overtime is nice!) and the whole scenario ignores the cost-savings of not having to ship goods from China to the US, which likely saves more than $1k/yr that could be paid to the workers or collected in additional taxes from the shareholders/executives...

Most likely, the native-born workers would either enter the Middle Class or form the more skilled/experienced group of workers (and make more than $4/hr, thus coming out ahead of where they were making $10/hr in the first scenario without an added $6/hr in Wage-Subsidies and Universal Basic Income).  Plus, cost-savings from keeping the factories domestic would provide additional funds to kick around.  And if all this still didn't suffice to keep the native workers at least as well-off as before, there's always deficit-funded increases to the Wage-Subsidies or Universal Basic Income; or assistance programs like college grants, low-interest emergency healthcare loans (to help people avoid medical bankruptcy- if a Single Payer healthcare system weren't also adopted), or refundable child/elder care and home energy-efficiency tax credits to consider... (all of these address major inefficiencies in society: namely that we don't invest enough in education or energy-efficiency, do enough to help people avoid medical bankruptcy, or sufficiently reward child/elder care as the socially valuable activity it is...)

---

All this produces valuable opportunities for socioeconomic advancement for both native workers (the chance to enter the Middle Class, in new positions created by an expanding population of lower-class Latino migrants) and Latino migrants (the chance to settle in a safe country where they can be protected by the rule of law from the violence in their home countries).

It helps us avoid a crisis from the graying of our populace and an expanding dependency-ratio (dependency ratio is the ratio of working-age adults to children and elders past their working years).

And, it brings new experiences, new perspectives, and possibly new geniuses and world-changers (remember, Albert Einstein was a foreign refugee)  to the United States.

It would need to be accompanied by an expansion of the available housing stock, training of more doctors and nurses, and establishment of new colleges and universities to avoid placing extra pressure on these critical goods and services.

"The basic income proposal is weird enough as is, but the campaign on it is by far one of the worst I've seen, IMHO.

* It suggests getting rid of the existing social safety net, without further explanation. The entire purpose of the current system is to only give money to those who need it; while there is always room for improvement, doing something completely different just for the sake of trying something new is absurd.  
This kind of reasoning, that because the current state is not ideal anything else is necessarily better, is unfortunately pretty common; Donald Trump is its incarnation, just like Berlusconi before (politicians are not doing a great job, therefore let's pick non-politicians).

* It uses the tired old ""luddites"" argument, claiming that this time there really will be job losses that aren't offset by the creation of entirely new job categories. Apparently, nobody has told them that not so long ago, virtually everybody was a farmer (and this is still more or less the case in some developing countries), yet we did just fine when we figured out how to reduce that to &lt;1%.

* The claim that ""the initiative is just a principle"" is ridiculous, it's a transparent cop-out to the obvious question ""How will it be done?"". The Parliament is not all-seeing and all-knowing, it can't magically put into law something that nobody knows how to do. If this passes, the same people currently supporting it will be storming the streets to protest whatever insane tax increases are suggested.

* The proponents don't seem to have even spent one minute thinking about the possible negative consequences: people working less overall which would lower the overall tax revenues (and thus make it harder to collect the money for the basic income itself), various forms of abuse e.g. by families with many kids, the disparity it'd create between Swiss citizens and foreigners, etc.  
Instead they circle-jerk with useless information such as the Mincome trial in Manitoba. Surprise, when you tell people it won't last, nobody quits their job because of basic income!

If you put the basic income away for savings/retirement (this in itself is probably good and means you're not the type to default on your obligations, which isn't good for us economically), then you probably already afford a decent living via your actual occupation or otherwise.

"There are 3 flavors of UBI (pro welfare, welfare neutral, and anti welfare). Obviously generalizing but the further left will want the pro welfare (stacking with welfare), the moderate parts of both parties will want welfare neutral (opt-in like Yang's plan), and the further right will want anti welfare (replacing all welfare, like almost passed in the 70's with Friedman's negative income tax).

That's just the politics angle though, there are a couple of milder arguments for welfare neutral, probably doesn't overcome the apprehension but worth considering.

1. Incentives for those on welfare- If you go searching you surprisingly find even already that some that are close to the benefits but over (say $1100, $1200, $1300 a month) would actually prefer to opt-in to the Freedom Dividend. From a math perspective that doesn't make sense but if you look at the reasons they give it centers around eligibility requirements/restrictions, time wasted, and the ability to climb out of poverty. The disability example is a big one especially those partially disabled that could work a little bit but certainly not 40 hours. The incentives of the current programs make it so working lowers their benefit with their case manager as well as can get them declared able bodied (even volunteering can do this in some cases). This really incentivizes them to do nothing and stay doing nothing, forever. On top of that just generally, want to save money to climb out slowly nope sorry. Then there is the case manager, hurdles to climb through, things to attend to get vouchers instead of cash, etc. This is a VERY poisonous mindset to get people into. The ""no strings attached"" part of the FD can flip this to this isn't a handout everyone gets it no conditions.

2. Cost- Unfortunately the welfare overlap portion of the funding for the FD is a huge chunk and this doesn't even include social security which most will also not opt-in. If you include those groups you almost double the cost of the program which is already trillions.",neutral,neutral

Currently there are X dollars spent on welfare programs, with administrative overhead. Roll it all into basic income instead, and alter the tax structure so that roughly the same people are still getting about X dollars net. Why wouldn't that be possible?

&gt; What is that person bringing to the table? Keep in mind we are bartering here.

You *really* lose me—and I assume people who think like me—with this point here. Whose table are we talking about here? 

Because 'that person' brings a lot of things to a lot of different tables. 
Take this hypothetical, say there is a UBI in the US of $30,000 and someone does not work but pays taxes—income tax, state/local, sales (if applicable)—well, that person is helping perpetuate the sovereign currency of the State, providing value to US dollar by paying taxes in it, purchasing goods/services within the economy, etc. Is your claim that person brings nothing to 'the table'?

If so, you are talking about a more specific table. I think you get at it here—

&gt; **The market** is offering one Resource (Money = Self-Sufficiency). That person has to bring something to the other side of the table as well. As of right now, they are bringing 40 hours of UNSKILLED Labor.

So what if I disagree with how 'the market' is structured. There are myriad criticisms of 'free' markets, I won't go into them here. 

Your broad claim, as I understand it is that for someone to *earn* a living wage, they ought to contribute something (of equal value?) to the 'system'. You don't really explain what the 'system' is that this person needs to contribute to in order to deserve a living wage. 

&gt; I personally think that some jobs exist so that you WANT &amp; NEED to get the hell out of them.

This is a pretty heterodox view of the labor market, but that aside, your entire point here seems to be geared around the value that the person provides to the 'free' market, not the state. Well, people are not citizens of markets, they are citizens of states and the value they create for that state is often unquantifiable in easy-to-comprehend market terminology—ie. military conscription, taxes (as a I mentioned before)—so why is it that you are placing these market based values above values to the State?

Not to mention, the mere existence of the jobs you describe above *necessarily* perpetuate inequality in society on immutable bases—mentally or physically handicapped people, people of color (in certain communities), sex/gender, etc.—so do you believe these people, born in a condition that does not allow them to achieve the desire to 'WANT &amp; NEED' to move past certain types of employment should be penalized by the happenstance of their birth?

Andrew Yang’s UBI was a good idea, if it were modified slightly where you had to be seeking employment or employed to receive the benefit, with no other strings attached. 


There are things I believe we should legislate. Firing someone because they are ill, thus cutting off their health insurance, should be illegal if it isn’t already. I recently had a family friend pass away. She had been in the hospital since September 17. She was in for 3 months and some change. Her employer never fired her. She obviously did not get paid, but she always had insurance. That should be a legal requirement for every company. We also need to lower costs of medication and doctor visits. Doing things like raising the minimum wage will not work in the long run, but setting some sort of, not price cap, but profit cap(I’ve never heard of an idea like this before, maybe I’m mistaken, but where you can only earn a certain amount of profit from a sale. Obviously would change depending on product) on medication. 

Make hospitals accept Medicare. It’s that simple. As long as Medicare doesn’t force hospitals to operate at a loss, make them take it. That would work in conjunction with profit caps. 


If we limit the prices of drugs, and force hospitals to accept Medicare as long as it doesn’t make them operate at a negative, private insurance and drug companies will have to become competitive. 

I do just want to comment on forced car insurance. That is one of the most stupid things I’ve ever heard of in my life. Let’s make it illegal for people to be poor, great idea. Similar to forcing people to have insurance with the ACA, except at least there’s a government alternative there. Anyways, insurance companies are crooked, we all know this. But there are ways to let them exist while still bettering the lives of citizens.",neutral,neutral

UBI will pay for itself not with the cost UBI brings, but with the social foundations it provides, and economic growth it will create. youre looking at this as a money=money valuation, which is always going to show ubi as 'too costly to implement'.

there are 2 UBI arguments usually. With, and without, welfare elimination. if we eliminate most welfare programs in favor of UBI, right there is, what, 500 billion? thats a good chunk of UBI already 'paid for' before we even get started. Andrew Yang also proposed introducing a VAT tax to help mitigate corporations from dodging tax payment. this would provide another good chunk of income to directly pay for UBI itself.

once UBI gets rolling, and people start actually spending money again, more taxes are collected. more goods are purcased. more jobs are needed. more taxes are collected. the cycle continues.

i personally dont care how much UBI costs. the cost of UBI will be directly proportional to the number of people receiving UBI, and how much is given each month. each and every person suddenly finding themselves no longer wondering how to put food on the table. or how to keep a roof over their head. so much worry, fear, and anxiety *poof* gone. no more incarcerations on homeless people for being homeless, resulting in lower prison populations and less prison expenditures. the value of society gained from a UBI, mental health, physical health (even without M4A, now people can somewhat afford minor procedures, like going to the dentist. or the gym), economic growth from more people now suddenly being able to pay for things. all of this, to me, far outweighs the 'but the cost!!!' argument.

- that policy should err on the side of compassion not cruelty

Additionally, funding UBI would require significant redistribution of wealth, which goes against the capitalist principle of allowing individuals to keep the fruits of their labor.

- If part of paying for it involves eliminating social programs, are people better off with UBI (where they can choose what to do with their money) compared to other programs where they can't? What do we do if someone spends all their UBI on addiction, do we just let them be homeless?
- Do people stop working when on UBI, resulting in declining tax revenues that make it impossible to fund? 25% of the study left their job, despite knowing that the UBI they were getting was only temporary - how many people will leave their job when they know they will be getting UBI for their whole life?

And if we gave a UBI to poor people... what?  They might not be so DESPERATE they would have to take those jobs to live if others fell through?  Then FUCKING pay them more if you want it done, you want them funneled there out of desperation and it being the last stop before hitting the pavement?  Under duress?

God damn animals.  This little squabble has enlightened me a great deal, the left has many factions, and I suspect mine is much smaller than who I am seemingly set against.  But there are some on the left whose end state is a world where more and more people have the basics taken care of, and the work they engage in is more about what they WANT to do, and not just what they HAVE to do to live.  And the other faction of the left, that sees people less as human beings, but cogs in a machine, laborers, foot soldiers in a war against capital and capitalism, infantrymen to be harnessed to burn down hierarchies.  Their purpose is to be the tip of the spear to grind in to power so that one day, we can all be equal in all things that matter, and live in harmonious collectives...

"To try to answer a couple of those points, but from a layperson: UBI wouldn’t “stack” with social welfare programs in most cases, but you could choose if you want to keep your programs or receive UBI. He wouldn’t take away your assistance if, say, you’re making $1500 already in welfare. What I like about that is that in our current system as you gain potential to earn, you lose welfare entitlement. Say you make $500/mo from work and $800 from welfare. Then you get a raise to $1k/mo but then you disqualify yourself from receiving as much welfare. It kind of incentives you away from progression. I like that UBI takes a huge portion of attempted incentivisation and administration away.

Also his closing the loopholes likely goes back to an implementation of the VAT, a tax. The US is the only modern economy without a VAT. The VAT is a mostly an un-gameable program that avoids the crazy tax codes that inadvertently create loopholes in our current tax system.",supportive,supportive

"This is a really great post and I’m glad that you made it. I have a few questions if that’s cool with you?

You started off by saying that the kids who could have become engineers but didn’t: they are missing out on seeing their full potential.

Wouldn’t you also agree that it takes an individual to apply themselves in work hard at doing whatever it is they do to maximize the potential that they’re born with? For instance you can see a guy like Morgan Freeman who was born completely poor, black in an era where civil rights didn’t exist, and yet he is one of the most successful actors of all time. Economically speaking, he worked hard and maximize the potential he had at every point in his life, and he is one of those people who say you should just pull yourself up by your bootstraps. I would not suggest that that is the case for everyone, but I also think it would be extremely unfair to tax everyone for the sake of those who don’t apply themselves or even attempt to make an effort. 

Taxing those who have applied to them selves, who have applied the resources, who are creating jobs for others in who are us building wealth not just in themselves but also in their businesses, I just think is wrong on the basis that you want to only help those who are not in those positions.

Taxing billionaires just discourages millionaires from claiming the billions that they could make, I just don’t see how it makes a whole Lotta sense. Now granted I am not nearly as financially literate as you are, so what I’m hoping is that you can read this comment see where I’m coming from but then help me realize where I might be wrong?

I’m really stuck on the part where you said kids all could just grow up and become engineers if given the chance: Every single child in America has that chance right now, even though they may have different levels of adversity to deal with; relatively speaking, everyone has some level of adversarial issue in their life that bars them from doing certain things, and others turn that into the fuel they need to propel themselves into a career that is rewarding. 

If we were to simply make every educational program in the country or even in the world free of charge to those who want to apply, that still does not solve the issue of those who will not apply themselves, but will take up those resources because they are being handed out. If you were to look at the welfare state in Georgia, for instance, laws were passed to Force anyone who applied for welfare/EBT cards would be asked to work a certain number of hours a week to be eligible, and had to do so through a number of listed organizations that worked with the state. What ended up happening was that the people who had applied, realize that they were working hours that they would be paid more for if they just found a regular job. And the numbers of people that were on those programs dropped significantly.

What I missing maybe, in your comment, is the rationale for why people would not abuse this or any other increase in programming that just hands out cash Under the assumption that people can’t simply work for themselves? We didn’t introduce a UBI when we got rid of the horse and carriage, even though cars were invented, do you see what I’m saying? I’m starting not to LOL",neutral,"This comment touches on a few different points and does not clearly express a stance on UBI. Therefore, it can be classified as neutral."

"&gt;It's pretty simple. A couple hundred years ago, it took about three quarters of the population to grow enough food for everyone. Now it takes about three percent, even with our horrible inefficient subsidized agricultural system. There's 14 unoccupied homes for every homeless person in the country. The resources exist to provide for every single person, but we distribute them in such a way that they can't get access to them.

Oh sure, in the immediate term there's resources on-hand, but in terms of technology whereby the amount of food, clothing, and shelter people need or want is communicated to those who produce those goods. I assume you have something in mind other than simply allowing people to set prices and exchange voluntarily.

&gt;If you need a doctor, you don't have any choice but to participate in our screwed up medical system, and if you need money, you don't have any choice but to participate in our screwed up employment system. That means that certain things are a given no matter what the individuals involved are like.

That doesn't really clarify things for me. I understand that we need medical care at times, but isn't demanding that someone provide me that care whether they want to or not and whether I will adequately compensate them or not, a bad thing?

&gt;It's a product of the system. If you're doing anything wrong, it's not participating in the system as it exists, but rather helping to maintain that system, and honestly I don't think you're even really guilty of that.

I definitely agree the system is imperfect.

&gt;Do you really think every single person would turn into a couch potato even if they had the opportunity? 

For the most part, yes. I think many more people would participate in non-productive activities or activities of very subjective worth like art and sports. I don't see anything wrong with that in and of itself. I just think that calls into question what few, even, would want to take it on themselves to keep the great mass of society comfortable. Not out of loathing for others, but simply because they could enjoy the same themselves.

&gt;It's just a matter of how they're distributed.

Yes, but that is an important matter. ;) In-fact it's so difficult to do all states to date have failed miserably at it.

&gt;Define ""leisure."" I mean, I can't speak for you, but I know I wouldn't be happy with just existing. I need to create things. And besides that, I'd like some luxuries so my leisure time is more enjoyable. Would I be working 40 hours a week? Hell no, but that's not required to keep society functional.

I'd be content to hike, hunt, fish, tend my garden, and generally enjoy my front porch.

&gt;Obviously food, clean water, and shelter. I would also argue that access to information and healthcare would count. Electronics are so cheap now that information is easy. All that stuff can be covered by a basic income, but health care is a little more complicated. There's really only two routes you can take with healthcare. You either make it completely universal and treat everyone, or you refuse to treat people who don't have insurance and can't pay. Personally, I lean towards the former option, but I can understand that there are advantages to the latter option as well.

Have you tried making a spreadsheet estimate for how much that might cost per-person in relative dollar figures?

&gt;Then tough shit. There has to be at least some motivation to work. We haven't quite reached the level of pushing a button and having anything you want yet.

So there is an enforcement mechanism as a back-stop in case too many people decide they'll just be on the take?

&gt;I'm certainly in favor of cheap, government constructed housing for people who don't need a whole lot of space. If someone else offers a better deal, I'm not gonna stop anyone from taking it. And if you want something better, you'll need to do at least a little work for it.

As someone who has supplied government contractors building said housing, it's not really cheap to construct. The lack of competition means prices are actually very high and the quality is extremely low. You would essentially be constructing a great mass of slums.

&gt;Well, I live in a small two bedroom apartment that's worth about 90,000 dollars, so I figure somewhere in the neighborhood of 100k in current dollars. I want to make it possible for everyone to own their own home without having to pay taxes on it. 

More generous than I thought, but if much of the resources are being diverted to these government housing projects, how will people be able to get the resources for private homes? I assume the state will get first-dibs on building materials.

&gt;Right, but that actually makes the problem worse. If success was completely random, it would still be a statistical certainty that some people would come out way ahead. But in fact some people have abilities that make them way more likely to succeed than others, which tilts things even more in that direction. Whether or not they ""deserve it,"" the fact that they'll get it is inarguable. 

How do you control for this? Kill the higher IQ children? Purposefully handicap them? Lavish twice the resources on more reluctant learners?

&gt;Well, fractional reserve banking definitely doesn't help matters. But it's really inherent to capitalism. Consider: Who will have an easier time starting a new business? Someone starting out with nothing, or someone who already owns a successful business and has large amounts of resources, experience, and contacts available?

Actually, fractional reserve systems are mercantile. But as for who is more likely to start a business: the person with an idea that can succeed as a business. I started from pretty much nothing. My wife and I had ~$2000 saved up and I got a loan from the local bank to match it, but we're still successful considering our idea worked out and people liked what we had to offer.

&gt;Are they? They are entirely reliant on money and media coverage to keep their seats. That means they're beholden to the people who have money. Look at what happened to Ron Paul, or any candidate the big corporations don't like.

Yes, I would say they are. Politicians have people killed, like Michael Hastings, MLK, JFK, etc. etc. Ron Paul was in office a very long time. I don't think that his career was in any way ruined by corporations, though he was of-course maligned by the politically-deferential media.

&gt;If they want someone to do something for them, they have to pay for it just like everyone else. They do have other means of getting people to do what they want them to do via the government, of course, but as I said before, that ability is heavily dependent on other people paying them.

Power of the purse resides with the congress (and the federal reserve). ;)

&gt;Because they don't want to fail, and with enough wealth at their command, they have the ability to suppress competition so that they don't fail.

Sorry that's just not true. Massive companies do go out of business or get sold off int bits and pieces. It's only when states step in and nationalize or subsidize that they have the ability to becoming immortal and suppress any chance at competition.

&gt;Well, capitalism doesn't exactly have a monopoly on corruption. But countering it requires putting strict safeguards on the people who have power, as well as distributing and diluting that power as much as possible. Those things are impossible in capitalism.

I would argue those things are not just possible, but always the case in a free market without a state. First, there is no arbitrary monopoly on any power. Second, the distribution and dilution of that power is in the interest of everyone in the marketplace.

&gt;There are a couple of measures you can take to prevent that. For starters, don't allow a deficit.

Oh I like that, but I don't think that will mix well with building tons of public housing and providing everyone 100k in spending money.

&gt;That means that any increase in social programs results in an increase in taxes, which isn't gonna be popular. And any decrease in taxes will result in a decrease in social programs, which also isn't gonna be popular. Is it perfect? No, but no system is.

If there are to be social programs in a free society that is how they should be funded. (So long as anyone can opt out)

"I recommend reading the article.  It's written from a social democratic standpoint and it brings up many salient points.  A UBI that isn't high enough to allow workers to turn down precarious labour will make the precarious labour situation significantly worse.  As long as people are dependant on lousy jobs, UBI will become little more than a subsidy for employers to justify lowering wages, as well as a subsidy for landlords.   They propose a benefit to top up those that fall below the poverty line would be significantly more impactful and cost a lot less.  There's also the issue of conservatives using UBI as a justification to gut other aspects of our social safety net.  $2000 a month without EI and Medicare and were significantly worse off than we are right now.  No doubt about it that we need a more robust system of social security and it's worth investing in, but UBI is not the cure all many think it is.

What will NOT stack is the means-tested programs. They will remain existent of course. Yang has no intention to remove them, but people who do not want to make the switch because they receive over $1k/mo in benefits will be able to stay with those programs.

As a side, there is good reason people will prefer UBI of $1k/mo over other welfare programs because of the nightmare that it can be.

The only programs that are opt-in with the freedom dividend are the programs that were created with the paternalistic racism, that Democrats like Joe Biden Believe in, these programs assert that the poor have made a mistake by being poor and should be punished.

This article by campaign associate and UBI activist Scott Santens should assuage those concerns. I too was initially concerned with this issue but then I read this article and it changed my entire perspective.

It's hard to grasp, but computers are becoming smart. When you write a program you don't need to rewrite it from scratch but can build on what already exists. Google, IBM and many others are teaching machines how to learn. Robots don't complain or slack off. They can run 24/7, 365 days a year. If you create a software program you can multiply it 7 billion times for an insignificant cost. 


Most jobs that can be broken down into a large number of small steps will be automated, it's just a matter of when. I'm not saying all jobs will be automated or that new jobs won't be created, but in the next 50 years there will be more jobs automated than created, causing an increase in the unemployment rate. Politicians do not debate the effects of an increase in automation but Futurists do.

This creates multiple points of failure: if the Treasury prints too much or too little money, if the reserve ratio is set too high or too low, or if lending practices are not optimal, the economy will experience a boom or a bust, often leading to changes in the amount of money printed, and/or the reserve ratio, and/or lending practices that will push the economy in the opposite direction, where the cycle repeats.

Instead, the Treasury should be the sole creator of money, and it should distribute it evenly via a universal basic income. That reduces the system to one point of failure, easily corrected. Banks will still make money by charging interest on loans, but they will only be able to loan money that has been deposited, they will still be required to have cash on hand to deal with withdrawals, and deposits will still be insured by the government.",supportive,supportive

The right is brainwashed heavily for 3 main reasons. 

1. Many of them are old. There was a time when examples above were described as “patriotic”. They are resistant to change because things were better when they were young. In reality, thats because the people of the time abuse our resources for short economic gain. 

2. The new Administration gives them a front.

""UBI provides up the poverty line which is defined as enough to get all the essentials""

It doesn't does it - otherwise it would be the living wage. There is no way the proposed UBI is enough to live on long term. You run out of clothes, cars, housing. Just like with Unemployment Benefit. 

The Alaskan dividend isn't enough to live on. Neither is UK Child Benefit or Universal Credit. Or even the State pension. 

And if it is enough to live on then people will do just that - back to my pensioner example of people on the golf course. 

Why should others prop them up with taxes if they are not adding anything to the pot. They won't. They'll vote to have it stopped or reduced to an inadequate amount - as they have in every single case so far.

""UBI is a domestic program and not meant to solve global exploitation of international labor.""

How do you feel about living off exploited labour elsewhere in the world that you can quietly and conveniently ignore by drawing an arbitrary boundary around your world?  

""Studies on UBI show that it doesn't lead to a decrease in employment.""

There has been no studies on a UBI covering an entire currency area. The ""studies"" are always in a small area linked to others with a fixed exchange rate - which is where the goods to prop up the utopia come from and where the unemployment therefore gets moved to. Another illusion.

And every single one of those schemes have ended. Stopped by pressure from the areas not getting the freebies. 

The studies all show that UBI doesn't work. Every single one of them.

"&gt; we can get UBI and regulate companies so that they don't abuse our data. It's not an either-or.

I probably didn't clarify my point well enough. Yang understands the tech industry better than any other candidate. [He put forth specific goals in regulating the industry](https://www.yang2020.com/blog/regulating-technology-firms-in-the-21st-century/), his 4 points being (emphasis mine): 

* **Regulate the use of data and privacy by establishing data as a property right.** The associated rights will **enable individuals to retain ownership and share in the economic value generated by their data.**
* Minimize health impacts of modern tech on our people, particularly our children. I will create a Department of the Attention Economy that focuses on smartphones, social media, gaming, and apps, and how to responsibly design and use them, including age restrictions and guidelines.
* Stop the spread of misinformation that is eroding trust in our institutions and fanning the flames of polarization in our society. I will scale up VAT on digital ads to hasten a shift away from ad-driven business models, **require disclosures on all ads, regulate bot activity, and regulate algorithms, addressing the grey area between publishers and platforms.**
* Adopt a 21st century approach to regulation that increases the knowledge and capacity of government while using new metrics to determine competitiveness and quickly **identifies emerging tech in need of regulation.** 

One of the primary ways Yang proposed to pay for UBI was by implementing a value-added tax (VAT) that could scale with different market sectors.

"The post that's linked is meant to show that the Freedom Dividend will help the majority of people who need welfare. Very likely a single mother with 3 kids will be helped by the Freedom Dividend. Plus, when those kids turn 18 they will begin receiving the FD, which will greatly help them start their own lives. Also keep in mind there are other policy proposals, like the [Prosperity Grants](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/prosperity-grants/), and just a likely increase in charitable donations from the increase in disposable income.

If someone is fortunate enough (at least relative to the majority of applicants) to be receiving more than $1000/month in welfare benefits, they can keep their current benefits and forego the FD. If they get a job/raise or otherwise disqualify themselves from their benefits, they will have the FD waiting for them.

UBI also acts as an economic stimulus, so for those receiving welfare because they can't find a job (especially in areas of the country that are in a bad economic state), job opportunities have the potential to increase.

So, yes, I'm sure there are examples of people who won't benefit from the FD in its initial incarnation. But the vast majority will, it gives a foundation for all, and it's a starting point to work forwards from.

"&gt;First off, neoclassical economics never claimed that people are wholly rational agents.

They may not *believe* people are purely rational agents, but the economic models *assume* it.  By necessity, models simplify reality.  It's obviously common across science and not always a problem, and can still generate useful insights and predictions. In being inextricably linked to human behavior, however, economic models are particularly prone to being simplified beyond utility.

&gt;However, if people are indeed irrational and never weigh opportunity costs to decide what's best for them and society,

This is a strawman.  Humans are not wholly irrational beings anymore than they are wholly rational beings.

&gt;This sounds like a cope to deny the existence of welfare trap altogether.

I don't deny some form of it exists in some select cases.  It's just not reflective of most people's behavior on welfare.  Most people on welfare work and most are on it for relatively short periods of time.

So, not my table, really.

Of course, per-capita-GDP-linked Basic Income could replace that system as well, because demographic variance isn't going to have as much of an effect on total cost of benefits, and a lower employment-population ratio will simply mean lower (but barring dramatic contraction, still-adequate) income supports during one's working life, which will be balanced by support over a longer period of retirement.

Losers:

Gillibrand, Harris

Meh:

Everyone else

This entire debate was a trainwreck. Almost everybody at one point in time tried to claw at Biden in some futile attempt to drag him down with their abysmal odds, and the few who didn't had a real chance to speak, including Yang who got shafted last time.

Booker seems to be the clear winner, but Castro has also been very strong. I like both of them

Yang makes his points very quickly and clearly without inciting or attacking others, and he has great moments when the moderators ask him questions that don't allow him to shift the narrative back to the economy or his UBI plan

Biden took a lot of hits, but honestly I don't think anything stuck tonight. Harris tried to make lightning strike twice and went after Biden again, only to get stung by the clapback on multiple occasions. She came out of this debate in a far worse position than before.

Everybody had some decent points tonight unlike yesterday where there were clear factions on stage, but it seems to me like everybody on stage save for Biden is just angling for a cabinet position for somebody who was on stage on night 1, the real candidates.",neutral,neutral

"Fuck the ultra rich, but becoming dependent on them through a pittance subsistence UBI as a lot of people seem to want, is not the solution. They'll just turn 99% of their marbles into real assets and then cut up the rest and divide them amongst us. Really we need a way to stop them from ever having that much in the first place.",against,against
"There's what I want, and there's what is good. What I want is a thousand dollars, so life can be easier for me. This is my egoic self-interest.

In the big picture, giving a billion ""Me"" 's a thousand dollars a month leads to a billion ""Me""'s spending it frivolously and making the rich *even* richer, in the long run. I can be an impulsive, stereotypically poor imbecile who only thinks of things in a first degree(I often am, as a matter of fact), not considering any strategic depth to the worlds problems, only being satisfied by the first idea that triggers a positive dopamine response in my brain, or I can sit down and actually criticize if this ""good feeling thing"" is actually **objectively** good.

UBI is quite plainly the stepping stone to a Capitalistic superhell. It *only* funnels money **up**.",against,against
"Whereas the basic income is typically conceived as a fixed amount that would be granted unconditionally and would be enough for a person to survive on, the National Dividend would vary depending on the performance of the economy. In other words, the dividend is indexed to productivity. No productivity, no dividend. The greater society's productivity, the greater the dividend. It is expected that, in a highly industrialized country, the dividend (in conjunction with compensated prices and massively reduced taxation) should be at least sufficient to meet each person's basic expenses and that its relative purchasing power vis-à-vis salaries and wages should also be growing as machines replace human labour in the productive process.",neutral,neutral

"Not voting is literally part of the problem.  The democratic party isn't perfect, but they're better than the alternative, and support for things like national healthcare, basic income(!!), are rising.

So we could vote for the party that sounds like progress (even if it isn't as much as we'd like) or we can not vote, roll the dice, and see what happens.",supportive,supportive

"Do you happen to live in a small town?

Where I live, families would need upwards of $38 per hr combined income just to scrape by. This is assuming conservative rent estimates. Myself personally, I was able to spend time with my Grandparents as a kid, but punishing the poor by revoking a basic income from them does absolutely nothing but entrench poverty.

This has nothing to do with either capitalism or personalism as far as I can see. Childcare centres, like any business, can be small and can reflect the spiritual and cultural values of the community. I’d also support eventually transitioning to a 7 hour work day such that parents can have more time with their children. 

Welfare is necessary because poverty is due to cost of living and unemployment, which are both independent of capitalism. They are endemic to all market based systems, even one composed of all small businesses. Subsidizing the life of the working poor by alleviating their financial needs with a basic income for children is the most personal and Christian thing we can do.",supportive,supportive

"No tinfoil hat needed.  And he is not shifting the Overton Window, unless it is to the Right.    Most people don't know Yang's actual policies, because the corporate media has not cared to make them clear.   He is the next stealth candidate for the establishment and met with Barack Obama last year.  

.   

1~     Yang runs with libertarians who want to destroy the social safety net.   His original UBI plan was written for that goal but then adjusted when he started getting bad press for it.  Read these articles, the first of which was written before the adjustment, and the second of which was written afterward.   It's chilling.

I had a Yang supporter tell me that I was being too harsh in judging Yang on a predatory policy that he abandoned ""many months ago.""  But if a politician just MONTHS ago is writing policies that cut benefits for the poor and target Social Security for elimination, we should pay attention to what they are telling us about themselves.    
.       

2~    Yang will not end the forever wars and regime change wars.  His policy website makes it clear that ending the wars is not a priority for Yang, and not even really on his agenda.  Despite some tepid words in other settings suggesting that there should be less war, the  ""Yang Doctrine"" establishes as just reasons for war exactly the arguments that are currently being used to defend the warmongering.   Under Yang, the wars would continue.    
.    

3~    Yang is an authoritarian who would expand the Patriot Act security state.   Yang's website doesn't even mention the Patriot Act!   He apparently is fine with the infrastructure of authoritarianism ushered in after 9/11.  Not just fine....He has indicated that he wants to EXPAND the crimes for which terrorism charges can be brought, thus increasing the pool of Americans who can become subject to this terrifying, unaccountable ""justice system"" in which due process is merely optional.   While Bernie understands the grave danger of our corporate-consolidated media that does the bidding of corrupted government, Yang expresses concern about ""fragmented media.""  He would INCREASE government control of what we see and hear, and he wants to police ""fake news.""   Yang also describes the beginning of what sounds a bit like the Chinese social credit system.  He wants government apps to track citizen behavior, such as volunteer work, so that the government can reward ""good citizens"" (my italics) with things like access to public officials.  This is creepy stuff; we have seen in China how goverment tracking of citizen behavior and social credit systems can and will be abused.  Notice that Yang's expressed concerns about surveillance are carefully limited to talk about corporations who take your data and sell it.  He does not touch the massive, unconstitutional government surveillance state that Edward Snowden revealed.     

.        


In short, Yang consistently is a danger on the policies that are most important to the oligarchy.   AND he is the candidate best positioned to help them achieve their Holy Grail:  ending Social Security and the social safety net.        
.      
  

People don't understand much about Yang's agenda, and that is by design.  His website throws out over 150 policies, both minor and major, and makes people sift through them all in order to figure out what the hell he really believes.  It takes a great deal of effort to go through it all and notice what is in there and what isn't, and what his overarching goal for government really is.  Most people know he is for UBI, but they have no idea what type of UBI, and they don't realize his establishment positions on war, the authoritarian state, and healthcare.  Like other establishment candidates, Yang lies about supporting Medicare for All but actually supports a much more conservative plan.     
.       

The corporate media and the online propaganda machine have been working consistently to give the vague impression that Yang is sort of like Bernie and Tulsi--lumping him in with them whenever they talk about ""anti-establishment candidates.""  But policy is what reveals Yang.   His actual policies aren't remotely similar to theirs.  In every major area, his policies are more in line with the goals of the corrupt oligarchy that runs this nation right now.   The huge areas I listed above are the key ones that reveal him, although he also is corporate on a host of other policies ranging from education to borders.     
.    

Yang has been flying under the radar, but he is the oligarchy's last stealth candidate, and possibly the most dangerous one.

"I don't disagree. I support a UBI and affordable higher education. In the long run, the goal is to eradicate poverty and coercion (including semi-coercive wage labor) everywhere in the world. We're probably fifty years from being able to pull off a global UBI, but it deserves to be a long-term target. As I've said, socialism is what globalism looks like if it has a conscience— and I am a globalist.

No one should starve, anywhere; and no one should be threatened with starvation into working— and people who will use starvation or withhold resources or even damage professional reputations (as I've experienced) as a means of coercion must be defeated, even if it requires violence.

Thing is, I have zero trust in the ""enlightened"" corporate overlords. I have worked for and with them. They are a bunch of authoritarians and while they are not traditionally fascist (insofar as they tend to take an apathetic stance toward national and global politics) they will become fascist if their interests are challenged— as they say, scratch a capitalist and a fascist bleeds.",supportive,supportive
"&gt;  An unconditional basic income guarantees survival in decent comfort

I don't think we'll have universal income in the next 10 years. I think there will be some suffering before people get why we need it, sadly. 

&gt;Most likely Artificial General Intelligence is reality. 

Doubtful, imo. That's an optimistic estimate. 

Imo, your predictions are off by 30-60 years. 

&gt;Scientists can replace the human body by a machine body except maybe the brain depending on whether neurons can be replaced by something else or not. Hopefully scientists know how to keep the brain healthy by then.

Make that 80-150 years :P. Understanding how to theoretically, maybe sort kinda do something doesn't translate 1:1 into actually being able to do it. Things take time. Wars slow us down. World-wide famine or ecological disaster could bring progress to a halt.

Yeah, we went from colonial life to walking on the moon in 200 years, but that doesn't mean that technological advancement will continue at that pace. The more advanced the tech, the more underlying science you need.

"I'm not sure. To get one of their budgets passed they had to drop the pledge to freeze basic income tax, which had been pretty central to their manifesto (in fact I remember Sturgeon tearing strips off Dugdale for wanting to ""increase tax for teachers and nurses"" in the TV debates).

I hope that UBI will be defined by a notion of basic needs *with dignity.*  If people are still forced to live in run-down apartments and eat unhealthy diets because inflation outpaces UBI (and because jobs will presumably become harder and harder to find as automation advances) then UBI could become a dead-end trap that leaves the no-longer-working class in a more miserable and less-empowered state than ever before.,neutral,neutral
